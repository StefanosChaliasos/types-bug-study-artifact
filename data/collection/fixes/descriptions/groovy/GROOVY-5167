I was playing with the following snippet:
{code}
import groovy.transform.TypeChecked
@TypeChecked void m() {
    def s = "1234"
    println s.toInteger()
    s = 1234
    println s * 3
    s = new Date()
    println s.year
    println s.format("yyyyMMdd")
}
m()
{code}
And the static type checker was complaining on the s.format() call.
The format() method is part of DateGroovyMethods, not directly DefaultGroovyMethods, for modularity sake, and hence it wasn't recognized.
