For the script below, when I annotate a method with @TypeChecked, and it has an implicit Object return type (no type, no def, nothing), the checker will complain because the last expression is actually a void statement. This kind of methods, just like plain Groovy, should be valid and return null.

{code}
import groovy.transform.TypeChecked

@TypeChecked m() {
    println "hello"
}

m()
{code}
