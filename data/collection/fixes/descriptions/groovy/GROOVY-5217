If a class contains a field declared as a closure and that you use that closure as a method, the type checker throws a missing method error.

{code}
class FibUtil {
                private Closure<Integer> fibo
                FibUtil() {
                    fibo = { int x-> x<1?x:fibo(x-1)+fibo(x-2) }
                }

                int fib(int n) { fibo(n) }
            }
{code}
