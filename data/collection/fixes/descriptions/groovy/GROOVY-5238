If a method call expression references a method from another class, the method called gets visited (if it is statically checked) even if the class doesn't belong to the same source unit. This triggers incorrect error reporting (errors in the wrong file).

Fixing completely this requires a large amount of work, so return type inference will only work for methods in the same source unit at first.

See TODO in StaticTypeCheckingVisitor.
