When compiling the following code:

{code}
@groovy.transform.TypeChecked
class Container {
    static lookup(Class clazz) { }
    static m() {
        lookup(Date)
    }
}

Container.m()
{code}

The static type checker complains with:
{code}
[Static type checking] - Cannot find matching method Container#lookup(java.util.Date)
 at line: 5, column: 9
{code}

Although it shouldn't complain here, since we're passing the Date.class as argument to the lookup method, which is correct.
