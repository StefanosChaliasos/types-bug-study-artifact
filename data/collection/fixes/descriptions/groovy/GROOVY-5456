The following class definition results in the error:

{code}
@CompileStatic
class StaticGroovy2 {
    def foo(Closure cls) {}
    def bar() {	foo{ it / 2 } }
}
{code}

>>> a serious error occurred: BUG! exception in phase 'class generation' in source unit '../src/StaticGroovy2.groovy' At line 10 column 8
On receiver: it with message: div and arguments: 2
This method should not have been called. Please try to create a simple example reproducing this error and filea bug report at http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GROOVY

It seem to fail only with the /, because it works with other operators like: + - *
