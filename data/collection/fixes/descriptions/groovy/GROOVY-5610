Imagine a method with the following signature:
{code}
def foo(List<? extends A> arg, String value='default')
{code}

And a method call:

{code}
foo(a)
{code}

Then in that case, the type checker will not verify that for argument {{a}}, the generics match the signature (only that {{a}} is a {{List}}).

A method call with all arguments set will not have this limitation.
