The typechecker does not realize that the <T> of the method shadows the <T> of the class and compiles this code without warning. The same code does not typecheck in Java.

{code}
public class GoodCodeRed<T> {
    Collection<GoodCodeRed<T>> attached

    @groovy.transform.CompileStatic
    public <T> void attach(GoodCodeRed<T> toAttach) {
        attached.add(toAttach)
    }
}
{code}
