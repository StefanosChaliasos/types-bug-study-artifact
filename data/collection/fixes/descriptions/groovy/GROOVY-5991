The event 'methodNotFound' of a type checker extension script does not get called at all for methods to which operators are turned, like e.g.,

...[Static type checking] - Cannot find matching method java.lang.Object#leftShift(int)....
@ line 9, column 9.
          bar<<1
          ^

If the source contains explicit "bar.leftShift 1", it works properly.

Either a specific event for operators should be added, or the 'methodNotFound' event should be called for these methods as well. Personally, I think the latter solution is better, but as always, might be overlooking something of importance.
