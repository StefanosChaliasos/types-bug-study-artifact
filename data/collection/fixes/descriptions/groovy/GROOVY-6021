Consider the following example:
{code}
def with(@DelegatesTo.Target Object target, @DelegatesTo(strategy = Closure.DELEGATE_FIRST) Closure arg) {
    arg.delegate = target
    arg.setResolveStrategy(Closure.DELEGATE_FIRST)
    arg()
}

@CompileStatic
def test() {
    def obj = [1, 2]
    with(obj, {
        print(last()) //error is here
    },)
}

test()
{code}

last() is DGM for List. 

There is two ways to resolve the issue:
1. resolve 'last()' to 'obj.last()'. So the code will work
2. register an error if you think that injected methods should not be resolved in 'DelegatesTo' context
