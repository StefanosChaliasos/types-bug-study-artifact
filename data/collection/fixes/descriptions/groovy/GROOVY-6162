This Groovy script fails to compile:

{code}
@groovy.transform.CompileStatic
class MyClass {
    static void main(String[] args) {
        println "Class loader: ${this.classLoader}"
    }
}

MyClass.main([] as String[])
{code}

It complains that {{MyClass}} doesn't have a {{classLoader}} property. It seems that the static type checker does not treat {{this}} correctly in the context of a static method/property/initialiser.
