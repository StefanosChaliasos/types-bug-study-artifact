For some reason, in the following code, the {{inject}} method is not recognized by the type checker:

{code}
@groovy.transform.TypeChecked
def foo() {
    [milk: [1,1.0], croissant:[4,0.85]].inject(0) { int sum, Map.Entry<String,List> entry -> 
        List<? extends Number> v = entry.value
        sum += v[0]*v[1]
        sum 
    }
}

foo()
{code}
