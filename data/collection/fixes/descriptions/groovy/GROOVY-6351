The issue is the following. If I declare a variable of a Java primitive type (for example an int) and try to access a static field in a type checked annotated method (such as MAX_VALUE), there is a failure stating '[Static type checking] - No such property: MAX_VALUE for class: int'. An example of this could be:

{code}

@groovy.transform.TypeChecked
void runMethod (){
int i = 10
println(i.MAX_VALUE)
}

runMethod()

{code}

However, running the same snippet without the annotation works fine. This happens as far as I know with all primitive types.
I don't know if the previous code is correct, given that as a primitive type you don't have static fields, and they only appear in runtime because of autoboxing, but I think there should be a consistency between the two situations.
Furthermore, I think this might be related with issue GROOVY-6349.

I attach some examples to use as test cases.
