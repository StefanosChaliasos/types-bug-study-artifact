Type checking for generic method type parameters does not work when calling from a static method to another static method for trivially simple cases.  

See the following gist:

I suspect this has gotten worse from 2.2.2 to 2.3.0-rc-1 as my project, FunctionalGroovy, does this a lot and I now have many compilation issues related to this when previous I did not.  A small number of these are genuine type checking issues.
