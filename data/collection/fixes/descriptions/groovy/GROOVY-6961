I'm experiencing a problem when I chain another iterator method closure after {{collectMany}}. The parameter type of the closure on the following method should be the element type of the list returned by {{collectMany}} and when using dynamic Groovy this works fine. The static type checker thinks the closure parameter should be {{List}} and is failing to compile.

See attached example.
