In the following code, the type of myVar variable is of type Base instead of Derived.  This behavior is different than Java.  
{code}
class Base {}
class Derived extends Base {
  public void sayHello() {
    System.out.println("hello");
  }
}

class GBase<T extends Base>{
  T myVar;
}
@CompileStatic
class GDerived extends GBase<Derived>
{
  GDerived() { myVar = new Derived(); }
  public void method() {
    // Groovy compiler thinks myVar is of type base and doesn't have sayHello
    myVar.sayHello();
  }
}

public class Main
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    GDerived d = new GDerived();
    d.method();
  }
}
{code}
