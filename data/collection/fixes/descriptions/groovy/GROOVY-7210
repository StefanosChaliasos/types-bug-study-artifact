giving this code to the static type checker {code:Java}
    Integer i = 0
    int[] a = [0]
    a[i] = 1
{code}
fails on the array access part with {code}[Static type checking] - Cannot find matching method [I#getAt(java.lang.Integer). Please check if the declared type is right and if the method exists.{code}
this code should be legal though
