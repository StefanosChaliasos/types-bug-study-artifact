When using @ClosureParams annotated methods with @TC or @CS, if after applying type hints and built-in resolution based on number of parameters, generics analysis etc., more than one candidate signature is found, the usage will be flagged as ambiguous with a warning. It would be nice if instead a mechanism existed to resolve the ambiguity.
