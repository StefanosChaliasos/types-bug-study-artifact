The following compiles without error... I don't think it should:

{code}
import groovy.transform.TypeChecked

@TypeChecked
class C extends Script {

    @Override
    List<String> run() {
        [11, 12]
    }
}
{code}

What I would expect to see is:
Cannot return ArrayList<Integer> from method returning List<String>
