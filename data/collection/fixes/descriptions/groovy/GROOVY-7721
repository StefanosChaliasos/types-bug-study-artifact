Create classes.java:
{code}
interface I {
    R[] method();
}

interface I2 extends I {
    R2[] method();
}

interface R {}
interface R2 extends R {}
{code}

compile it with JDK 8 javac.

Then create usage.groovy:

{code}import groovy.transform.CompileStatic

@CompileStatic
class Gr {
    R2[] x(I2 i) {
       return i.method();
    }
}
{code}

Compile it with groovyc (also run with Java8) with the classes from previous compilation in the classpath. Compilation fails:

{code}
usage.groovy: 6: [Static type checking] - Reference to method is ambiguous. Cannot choose between [R2[] I2#method(), R[] I2#method()]
 @ line 6, column 15.
          return i.method();
                 ^
