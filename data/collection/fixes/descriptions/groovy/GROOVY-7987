Example code which fails at runtime but should fail at compile time:
{code}
class Foo {
  def bar() {}
}

@groovy.transform.TypeChecked // MME at runtime, the same as dynamic groovy
//@groovy.transform.CompileStatic // would give GroovyCastException at runtime
def method() {
  Foo.bar()
}

method()
{code}
