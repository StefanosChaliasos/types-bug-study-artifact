I managed to boil this down to static method versus non-static method.  When I use the spread operator in a Set to access a property (backed by getter), I am getting a type checking error.  If I remove the TypeChecked, all is well.  If I remove static from the method, all is well.

{code}
@groovy.transform.TypeChecked
class Foo {
  static def meth() {
    Set<java.beans.BeanInfo> defs = []
    defs*.additionalBeanInfo
  }
}
{code}

Error during compile (or in the IDE):
Foo.groovy: 11: [Static type checking] - No such property: additionalBeanInfo for class: java.util.Set <java.beans.BeanInfo>
