Now following code failed to compile : 
{code}
@CompileStatic
class Gr {
    void f1(Object obj) {
        if (!(obj instanceof Runnable)) {
            return
        }
        f3(obj) // failed compiled here  : Cannot find matching method Gr#f3(java.lang.Object). 
    }

    void f3(Runnable r) {  }
}
{code}

I have implemented fix and can submit fix, if needed.
Idea doesn't highlight this code as error, but groovy compiler failed.
