The error returns on line 22 of the attached file:

return new IntegerPairIterator(unionKeys.iterator())

Assigning to a temporary variable and returning on a second line OR removing @StaticCompile will fix the problem.

I thought this was related to GROOVY-8590 because it first occurred in Groovy 2.5.0-rc-3, but it was not fixed in Groovy 2.5.0.
