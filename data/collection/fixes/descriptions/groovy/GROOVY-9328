        new Runnable() {
            @groovy.transform.CompileStatic
            @Override
            void run() {

    }
}{code}
Expected: code is compiled without errors.
 Actual: 2 Â errors:
{{Cannot call private method C#privateMethod from class C$1}}
{{Cannot call private constructor for C from class C$1}}

Note that Java compiles the same code just fine.
