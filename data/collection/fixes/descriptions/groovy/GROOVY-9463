Consider the following:
{code:groovy}
@groovy.transform.TypeChecked
void test() {
  def closure = String.&toLowerCaseX
  java.util.function.Function<String,String> reference = String::toLowerCaseX
}
{code}

Neither of these misspellings result in a compiler error.  Also no metadata is saved in the AST to understand what method is being referenced if the names are fixed.
