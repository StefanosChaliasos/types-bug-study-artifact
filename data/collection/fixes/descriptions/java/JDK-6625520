In DefaultFileManager, getFileForInput assumes that if a path entry is not a directory, it must be an archive. This applies even if it does not exist.

Separately, openArchive assumes FileNotFoundException will be thrown if the archive is missing.   This may be true on some systems, but is not required to be true. For example, on Ubuntu linux, you get java.io.IOException if a file is not found.  This causes a spurious diagnostic to be generated.
