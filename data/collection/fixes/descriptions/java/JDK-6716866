Depending on the JDK being used as a baseline, some javac jtreg tests fail because of ambiguous classes in the classpath for JavacFileManager, now that it has moved from the .util package to the new .file package.

The tests affected are

    * tools/javac/T6358024.java : TaskListener should be propogated between processing rounds
    * tools/javac/T6358166.java : -verbose reports absurd times when annotation processing involved
    * tools/javac/T6358168.java : JavaCompiler.hasBeenUsed is not set in delegateCompiler
    * tools/javac/T6625520.java : javac handles missing entries on classpath badly
