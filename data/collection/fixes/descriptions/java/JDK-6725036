The proposed new javap -sysinfo option has revealed a bug in the value of lastModifiedTime() used internally by javac when a class comes from a zip file archive.

Here is the output for java.lang.String:

JavapTask: /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.03/jre/lib/rt.jar(java/lang/String.class) 
Classfile jar:/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.03/jre/lib/rt.jar!java/lang/String.class

(Note:  Jan 11, 1970)

Here is the corresponding output from unzip:
    15572  09-24-07 22:49   java/lang/String.class
and from jar
 15572 Mon Sep 24 22:49:32 PDT 2007 java/lang/String.class

This needs to be fixed, as javac uses last modified time internally to determine if class files are up to date.
