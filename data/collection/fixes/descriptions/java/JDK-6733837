It seems that recent work in javac diagnostic system introduced two little regressions problems:

1) DiagnosticSource refactoring introduced some problems wrt tab characters so that sometimes javac reports a wrong column position when printing a diagnostic

2) When a diagnostic is printed, the source basename (instead of the fullname) of the file the diagnostic refers to is printed. This regression is due to the recent refactoring of diagnostic formatters.
