From Maurizio:

*) My sanity script usually begins with a:
hg revert test/tools/javac/links/b/B.java

This is because of a buggy regression test - I think we discussed this a couple of time before; the essence is that if you clean through ant, ant will follow symbolic links and will end up in deleting B.java from the test/ folder! This is why I check for the presence of B.java before executing regression tests.
