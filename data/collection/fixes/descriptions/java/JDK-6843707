The following test scripts write files into the test/ directory.
test/tools/javac/meth/MakeNegTests.sh  
test/tools/javac/quid/MakeNegTests.sh

The following files are generated, as shown by "hg status"

? test/tools/javac/meth/InvokeMH_BAD68.java
? test/tools/javac/meth/InvokeMH_BAD72.java
? test/tools/javac/quid/QuotedIdent_BAD61.java
? test/tools/javac/quid/QuotedIdent_BAD62.java
? test/tools/javac/quid/QuotedIdent_BAD63.java

It is very bad practice to mutate the test/ directory and may cause problems on some systems.

These tests need to be fixed to use the jtreg scratch directory (the current directory while running the tests)
