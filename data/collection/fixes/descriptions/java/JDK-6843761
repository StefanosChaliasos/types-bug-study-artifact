Unlike most other Java programs, javac regression tests should by default not have a specified -source or -target setting.  That way, by default tests are assumed to be applicable to the next version of Java too, which is usually true.  In specialized cases, tests are -source or -target version specific.

Spurious settings of -source and -target should be purged from the regression tests suite.  This will improve the effectiveness of testing of the repository.

(Explicit -source settings are needed to test new language features in a release when the default source/target is earlier than the latest source/target.)
