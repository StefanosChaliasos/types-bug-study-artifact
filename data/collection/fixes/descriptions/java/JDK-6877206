The spec for File.toUri contains the following:

>> For a given abstract pathname f, it is guaranteed that
>>    new File( f.toURI()).equals( f.getAbsoluteFile()) 


On Windows, the result of f.toUri() is something like
	file://C/w/jjg/work/....
When I try and use  new File(f.toUri()) I get the following exception

java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: URI has an authority component

This is with JDK 1.7, on Windows XP SP2, using Cygwin.
