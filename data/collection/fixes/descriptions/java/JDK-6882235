A floating point constant of zero with an invalid exponent will cause javac to silently crash.

Compile:
	class Test { double d = 0ea ; }
Output:
	play/Test.java:3: malformed floating point literal
	    float f = 0e*;	// invalid exponent

Note the compiler does no report the number of errors found.   This is incorrect behavior.
