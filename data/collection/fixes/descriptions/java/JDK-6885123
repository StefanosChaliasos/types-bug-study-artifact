From Peter Ahe:
The problem [with FileObject#getName()] is that when I added getName, it was accidentally
implemented by a deprecated method in BaseFileObject. This method
returns the base name, for example, "Object.class" rather than
"/usr/java/jdk/lib/ct.sym(META-INF/sym/rt.jar/java/lang/Object.class)".

The intent was that this method would return a name which tells the
user something, but does not use an absolute path if the user didn't.
