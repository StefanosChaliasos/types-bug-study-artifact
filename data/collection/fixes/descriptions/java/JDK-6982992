The default timeout in jtreg is 2 mins.  I get the following times for these two tests:

                           2.66GHz Dual Core PC    Sun-Blade 2500:
                           --------------------    --------------- 
CheckAttributedTree.java:        2:47                 3:47
TreeScannerTest.java:            2:07                 2:30
TreeScannerTest.java has been replaced by two tests that subclass it, JavacTreeScannerTest.java and SourceTreeScannerTest.java.

In addition, TreePosTest.java suffers from the same problem.
