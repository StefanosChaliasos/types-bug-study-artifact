The compiler should not crash when reading class files containing JSR 292 constructs.

In particular, the new constant pool entries described here should not cause the ClassReader to crash:

http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~jrose/pres/indy-javadoc-mlvm/

These entries are CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic (decimal 17) of length 5 bytes including tag byte, CONSTANT_MethodType (decimal 16) of length 3 bytes, and CONSTANT_MethodHandle (decimal 15) of length 4 bytes.  None of these constant pool types affect the external API of a classfile, so the compiler's class reader can skip their bytes.


This bug affects the javap command also.  The "-c" mode of javap will want to decode the new constant pool entries.

This bug is similar to one for Pack200 (6981776), which also needs to process the new constant pool entries.
