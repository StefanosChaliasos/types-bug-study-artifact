We have encountered JCK failures lately, which were tracked down to losing some annotations in class files.

Example:
  @interface Simple { }
  interface Test<@Simple T> { }

Compile it with an older compiler, then use javap to see RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations
Compile it with a recent compiler, then use javap, and see RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations not there.
