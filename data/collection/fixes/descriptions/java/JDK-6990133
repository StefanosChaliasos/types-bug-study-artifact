AnnotationProxyMaker.ValueVisitor.typeMismatch defines an anonymous inner class that tries to serialize the non-transient non-serializable parameter "method".

The anonymous inner class should be defined as local or nested class that defines a transient field for the value.

There are two instances of AnnotationProxyMaker.ValueVisitor: one in APT, one in JSR 269. The same fix should work for both, so I would suggest fixing the APT code as well, to get rid of the findbugs warning.
