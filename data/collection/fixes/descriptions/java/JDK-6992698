The initial version if compiler changes supporting 292 features contained special syntax for denoting return type in a polymorphic signature call. Such syntax, leveraging explicit type-arguments in method calls, has been dropped in favor of a syntax leveraging cast:

BEFORE:

s = mh.<String>invokeExact("daddy",'d','n');

AFTER:

s = (String)mh.invokeExact("bunny",'n','d');

Old syntax is still allowed in order to favor migration of existing 292 clients to the new syntax - however, such support is meant to be transient and, consequently, is to be removed.
