Javac doesn't disable error messages coming from diamond inference when in 'diamond finder' mode. As a result, compilation of certain sources might result in error messages:

class Test<X extends java.io.Serializable & Comparable<?>> {
Test() {}

{ new Test<Integer>(); }
}

In the above case, diamond inference (if applied) would end up inferring a non-denotable type. We certainly don't want this error to spill out when in 'finder' mode.
