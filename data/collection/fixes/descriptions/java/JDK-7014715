Compiling reg test InterfaceInInner.java

class InterfaceInInner {
    InterfaceInInner() {
        class foo {
            interface A {
            }
        }
    }
}

fails as expected but as of nightly build of 1/25/11 returns 4 instead of 1.
This other reg tests which failed like this are
AnonStaticMember_2.java and QualifiedNew.java
