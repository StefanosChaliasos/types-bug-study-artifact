JSR 334 introduces a new flavor of type: a disjunctive type that can (in JDK 7) only be used for exception parameters.  The tree API in javac models the type alternatives directly.  When running a JSR 269 annotation processor in conjunction with the tree API, it would be preferable if the Element and Type objects corresponding to declaration of a disjunctive type on a exception parameter appeared as disjunctive types as well.
