For the purposes of type checking, the effective type of an exception parameter with a union type (as in a multi-catch statement) is the lub (least uppper bound) of the types of the alternatives.  When these alternatives all implement the same interface, the lub is an intersection type SomeException & CommonInterface.

Tests should be added to verify this structure is typed properly.
