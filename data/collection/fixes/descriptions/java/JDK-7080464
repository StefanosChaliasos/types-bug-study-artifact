When the JDK 8 langtools regression tests are run with assertions enabled, test failures are triggered:

Execution failed: `main' threw exception: java.lang.AssertionError

   * tools/javac/api/TestJavacTaskScanner.java : Additional functionality test of task and JSR 269
   * tools/javac/diags/MessageInfo.java : Automatically generate info about how compiler resource keys are used 

These failures should be fixed.
