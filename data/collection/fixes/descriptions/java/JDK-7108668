There's currently a circularity in javac initialization: bad options on the command line need to be reported somewhere, and some options say where to report diagnostics. The current resolution involves separate resource bundles and separate mechanisms to access them, in Log and Main.  By allowing Log to be initialized earlier, and updated as needed, we should be able to simplify this complexity.
