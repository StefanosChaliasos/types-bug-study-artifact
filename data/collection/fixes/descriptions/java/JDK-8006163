# javadoc tool doesn't	work through API. This should work since the way the compiler is supported is
# to add tool.jar from the jdk. With the extension of the tools api, to provide access to the javadoc
# tool, this approach exposed javadoc. However, there is no explicit requirement to support javadoc.
