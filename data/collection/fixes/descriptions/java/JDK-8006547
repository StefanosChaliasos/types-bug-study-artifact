Test case: Foo has @Target with all ElementType enum constants and FooContainer does not have @Target.

Based on this rule, the above test case should compile:
If an annotation is not meta-annotated with @Target, then the compiler treats the annotation as if it is meta-annotated with all of the ElementType enum constants that appear in Java 7: ANNOTATION_TYPE, CONSTRUCTOR, FIELD, LOCAL_VARIABLE, METHOD, PACKAGE, PARAMETER, and TYPE

Expected: code should compile fine.
Actual behavior: Compiler error:
NoTargetonContainer.java:9: error: target of container annotation FooContainer is not a subset of target of repeated annotation Foo
@ContainedBy(FooContainer.class)
^
1 error
