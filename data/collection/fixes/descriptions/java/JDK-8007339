To work around 8005681 and enable more testing,
tools/javac/annotations/typeAnnotations/classfile/CombinationsTargetTest1.java and 
tools/javac/annotations/typeAnnotations/classfile/CombinationsTargetTest2.java
can be cleaned up to extract the failing case to a separate test (Test1) and put in a conditional block to disable certain failing cases (Test2).
