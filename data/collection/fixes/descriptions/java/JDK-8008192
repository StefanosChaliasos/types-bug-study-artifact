Since the specification for the repeating annotations feature does imply an ordering of the results, the test of that feature

     tests/tools/javac/annotations/repeatingAnnotations/combo/ReflectionTest.java

should also test for matching order in its compareAnnotations method.

If ordering discrepancies are found, at least one of the test and implementation should be changed.
