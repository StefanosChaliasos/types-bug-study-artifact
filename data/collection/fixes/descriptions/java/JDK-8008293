This should compile:

interface SAM<X extends Number> {
    void m(X x);
}

class Test {
    SAM<?> s = (x)->{};
}

The spec EDR says that if the declared bound does not depend on any other type parameters, the declared bound should be used in place of the wildcard in the inferred target/descriptor type.
