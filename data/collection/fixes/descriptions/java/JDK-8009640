Consider test file like this:
-------
public class Test {
     javax.swing.JButton b;
}
------

This correctly fails to compile with -profile compact1:
$ javac -profile compact1 Test.java 
Test.java:2: error: JButton is not available in profile 'compact1'
     javax.swing.JButton b;
                ^
1 error

But the compilation is successful if -bootclasspath is specified (to the rt.jar from the compiler's JDK):
$ javac -profile compact1 -bootclasspath <path-to-jdk>/jre/lib/rt.jar Test.java
resulting in a classfile that won't be able to run in the compact1 profile.

Specifying -bootclasspath may be necessary e.g. when -source is used.

Version:
$ javac -fullversion
javac full version "1.8.0-ea-b79"
