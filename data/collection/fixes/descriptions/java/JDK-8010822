Javac's interpretation of intersection type cast applied to a lambda/method reference does not follow the JLS. Javac checks that the intersection type is like the following:

SAM & ZAM1 ... ZAMn

The spec text mandates that:

*) the whole intersection must be a SAM, call its descriptor D
*) there must be a SAM in the intersection whose descriptor is the same as D - that is the primary target used for code generation
