When getting modifiers of an interface, Symbol.getModifiers reverts AC_ABSTRACT if the interface contains default. This is a combinations of a fix that was put in place to preserve correctness of flags for default methods when accessed through compiler API and fact that javac internally marks interfaces with default with a special DEFAULT flag (same used for marking default methods).
