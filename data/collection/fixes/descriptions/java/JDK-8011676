Currently, JavadocComment is defined as an inner class in JavadocTokenizer.JavadocTokenizer.  This means it keeps a reference to JavadocTokenizer, which indirectly means it has reference to the source buffer for the file.  This means that in javadoc mode, every JCCompilationUnitTree is keeping its source buffer in memory. Oops.
