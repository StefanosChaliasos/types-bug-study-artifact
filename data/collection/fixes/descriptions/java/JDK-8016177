Code like the following:

static <T,R> Stream<R> map(Stream<T> s, Function<T,R> f);
static <T> IntStream map(Stream<T> s, ToIntFunction<T> f);
Stream<String> ss = ...;
map(ss, s->s.length()); 

Doesn't work, as the lambda is 'stuck' during overload resolution, which means both methods will be applicable. In turn, for structural most specific to kick in, we need same parameter types on corresponding functional descriptors, which is not the case here (alpha-renaming).
