I've recently seen langtools/tools/javac/T6725036.java start to fail in JPRT with the JDK8 CPU forest (strangely I haven't seen it fail in tl, yet).

I cannot see anything obvious in the 8CPU forest that would cause this. In fact, it is more likely that 7012868 may have impacted on this, since javac seems to have duplicated some of the logic for translating dos2JavaTime, or possible not supporting exted timestamp field?

It fails on some Linux and Windows JPRT machines as follows:
