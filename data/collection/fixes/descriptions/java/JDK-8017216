Run the test attached, it runs Javac through JSR199. It should print a start and end position (of the diagnostic) larger than 0, but it prints -1 as the end position.
The code Javac compiles looks like this (the error for 'B' has no end position):
"public class Test{ Object o = new A().new B(); class A { } }"
