FULL PRODUCT VERSION :
I am unable to check it ? I had to uninstall it immediately to continue in my work. It was this package: jdk-7u25-macosx-x64.dmg downloaded yesterday (19. June 2013).

ADDITIONAL OS VERSION INFORMATION :
Mac OS X 10.7.5


A DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM :
The compiler is unable to handle diacritics in file names used in my native language (Slovak). For example: the compiler has created from the file named Farebnos?.java the file named Farebnos?.class which was unusable. I had to return to previous Java version immediately because this bug made the new version not applicable for me.

REGRESSION.  Last worked in version 6u45

STEPS TO FOLLOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM :
Create any source file which name is containing diacritics (like ?) and try to compile it on Mac OS X (10.)7.5

EXPECTED VERSUS ACTUAL BEHAVIOR :
EXPECTED -
Fully functional file with correct name, for example: Farebnos?.class
ACTUAL -
File with damaged diacritics in its name, for example: Farebnos?.class

ERROR MESSAGES/STACK TRACES THAT OCCUR :
None ? the file created by compiler is unusable.

REPRODUCIBILITY :
This bug can be reproduced always.
