Javac accessed through JSR199 doesn't give the end position and it gives the wrong start position for some uninitialized variable errors. The start position of the error points to 'class' of the enclosing class of the variable. Compile and run the program below, it should print 2 errors with valid start/end positions and point to the usage and definition of the variable. Instead, the second error has no end position and doesn't point to the variable definition.
