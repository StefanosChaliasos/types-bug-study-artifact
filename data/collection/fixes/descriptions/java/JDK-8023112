Somehow javac is mixing up the method type argument with the class type argument when the method reference is like 
MyTest<Q>::<Object>new,
where Q is a reference type.
The correct behavior here must be to ignore the method type arguments and proceed cleanly -- see, for example, this comment from 15.12.2.1:

"This clause implies that a non-generic method may be potentially applicable to an invocation that supplies explicit type arguments. Indeed, it may turn out to be applicable. In such a case, the type arguments will simply be ignored."

For nested classes compilation succeeds. The problem happens for top level classes only.
