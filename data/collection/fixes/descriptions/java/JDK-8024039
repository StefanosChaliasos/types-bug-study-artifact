An empty try statement should not get up to Gen. If the try statement has a finalizer, then only the finalizer should be generated. This should be caught at Lower.

The only case where Gen should deal with a try with an empty body is in the face of a synchronized statement. In this case Gen itself, depending on the user code, can generate a try with an empty block, but the code generated in this case is correct.
