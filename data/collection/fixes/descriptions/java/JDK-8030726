The test tools/javac/NoStringToLower.java enforces a rule that String.toLowerCase is not used in any langtools source.  However, the test is enforcing this on any class with the package prefix com.sun.tools.  The result is that we are enforcing this rule on classes that do not originate from langtools source.

To ensure that this does not happen, the test should enforce the rule for the following package prefixes:

com.sun.tools.classfile
com.sun.tools.doclet
com.sun.tools.doclint
com.sun.tools.javac
com.sun.tools.javadoc
com.sun.tools.javah
com.sun.tools.javap
com.sun.tools.jdeps
com.sun.tools.sjavac

Priority is P2, as this is a test failure.
