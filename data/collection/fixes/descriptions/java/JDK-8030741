Lambda Spec bug JDK-8028800 modifies the treatment of nested generic method invocations in which the return type is an inference variable.  javac should implement the new logic.

This is important to minimize incompatibility with the javac 7 algorithm.

Three cases are considered:
- The return type needs to be captured
- The return type needs to have unchecked conversion
- The return type needs to be unboxed

The last one is already implemented, but may be subtly different in some corner cases.
