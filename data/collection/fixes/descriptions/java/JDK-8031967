The attached source file takes the javac 2s to compile on JDK 7u45. It takes 80s on JDK 8. The file is file from real life - a user of the IDE was trying to edit his source code.

Although the compiler finishes I consider this a crash since it effectively takes so much time that it is like not finishing at all. Moreover as we use the compiler inside NetBeans IDE the compiler in such case eats  all memory and our whole IDE dies because of that.

There is no workaround on our side - we cannot catch some exception or something. Also for the command line use of the javac - there might be cases (quite common in fact) that the compiler will not finish.

Hence marking the problem as P2.

Here is the simple repro test on my machine (using the attached file):
