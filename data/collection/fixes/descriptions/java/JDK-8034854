Spec: "If a class file has a version number that is greater than or equal to 51.0, and has an InnerClasses attribute in its attributes table, then for all entries in the classes array of the InnerClasses attribute, the value of the outer_class_info_index item must be zero if the value of the inner_name_index item is zero."

Synthetic class has inner classes attribute and inner_name_index is zero, but outer_class_info_index is not zero.

To reproduce use attached code.
