This test case used to result in a crash. The crash was fixed in b120 and this test case now unexpectedly compiles when using jdk8 javac and -source 7.

@interface Simple {}
class Test { 
void m1() { Integer i = new @Simple Integer(10); }
void m2() { throw new @Simple RuntimeException(); } 
}


It fails to compile as expected with jdk7 and jdk8.
