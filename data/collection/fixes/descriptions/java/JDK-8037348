Consider this source code:
---
import java.lang.annotation.*;
public class AnnotCopiedToAnonymous {
     private Object o = new @Annot Object() { };
}
@Target({ElementType.TYPE, ElementType.TYPE_USE})
@interface Annot { }
---

The generated anonymous innerclass (AnnotCopiedToAnonymous$1) has the Annot annotation as a declaration annotation in its RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations in addition to having it in its RuntimeInvisibleTypeAnnotations with a supertype target.

The annotation should not be listed in the RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations attribute, see:
