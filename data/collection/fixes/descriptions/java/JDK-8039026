The following erroneous code compiles on JDK8:

public class Test {
  final int y;
  final int z = this.y; 
  { y = 1; }
}

If z is instead initialized to 'y', then the appropriate error is given ("variable y might not have been initialized").

This may be related to a javac change for 7004835, whereby 'this.y' (not just 'y') is an "access" to a variable. Of course, since 'this.y' is an access, and the y variable is definitely unassigned at that point, an error is due.
