FULL PRODUCT VERSION :
java version "1.8.0_05"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_05-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.5-b02, mixed mode)

ADDITIONAL OS VERSION INFORMATION :
Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]

EXTRA RELEVANT SYSTEM CONFIGURATION :
Core i7 860 2.8Ghz
12GB RAM
C: is an 335GB SSD disk 25% of space used

A DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM :
I compare the time javac 1.7.0_55  and javac 1.8.0_05 use to compile a .java file.
javac 8 use 6 seconds where javac 7 uses 1.5 seconds.

This is a problem for us since the attached test code is a tiny example of the code we generate and compile using the Compiler API while running our program, and while the user is waiting. 
We compile it because we expect it to be evaluated many times.
We compile many thousands of this size of functions.

REGRESSION.  Last worked in version 7u55

ADDITIONAL REGRESSION INFORMATION: 
java version "1.7.0_55"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_55-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.55-b03, mixed mode)


STEPS TO FOLLOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM :
I used this in a .bat file to time the compile process.
--
echo %time%

cmd /c "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_55\bin\javac.exe" C:\test\TestClass.java

echo %time%

cmd /c "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_05\bin\javac.exe" C:\test\TestClass.java

echo %time%
--

Summary of the result I get is: 
java7 1.5s 
java8 6s
e.g. Javac8 is a factor of 4 slower.



EXPECTED VERSUS ACTUAL BEHAVIOR :
EXPECTED -
I expect javac 7 and 8 to be same speed for java7 source code
ACTUAL -
javac 7 is a factor 4 faster than javac 8

REPRODUCIBILITY :
This bug can be reproduced always.
