For some reason, the code in SJavacTestUtil thinks it necessary to check if the .class file for a .java file is up to date and compiles it if necessary. 

Since this is standard functionality for jtreg, the code should be removed and replaced by the equivalent jtreg @build actions.

That leaves almost no reason for the *Wrapper classes to exist.   The one remaining check left in SJavacTestUtil (to see if sjavac is on the classpath) can be done as a library call in each of the tests, without requiring a whole extra wrapper class.
