sjavac.Main.main continues non-trivial work and two calls of System.exit().

It is better practice to structure such code into a method (often called run) which does the same work but instead of calling System.exit, simply returns an exit code and/or throws exceptions instead.  In other words, code is better structured as

void main(String... args) {
    Main m = new Main();
    try {
        int rc = m.run(args);
        System.exit(rc);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.exit(ERROR);
    }
}

This makes it much easier to write test programns which can call the run method without having to worry about it calling System.exit
