This test case:

class Tmp
{
    final FunctionalInterface notInitialized = ()-> {
            FunctionalInterface simpleVariable = () -> notInitialized.foo();
    };
}

interface FunctionalInterface {
    void foo();
}

should be rejected by javac as notInitialized is being used in the initializer
