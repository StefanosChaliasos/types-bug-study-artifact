During work on JDK-8049130 for creation of golden files for negative tests, it was discovered that the error message reported for tools/javac/annotations/neg/Z3.java is not as expected. 

Currently, javac reports about the missing body or abstract decl or value() method for the test. This error message can be considered a secondary error message w.r.t. the test. javac instead should also report about the usage of default and this error should be the primary error message. 

Test name: tools/javac/annotations/neg/Z3.java 
Test code: 
enum Color { red, green, blue }
class Colored {  Color value() default Color.red; }

Current error diagnostic (secondary):
compiler.err.missing.meth.body.or.decl.abstract

Expected error diagnostic (primary):
compiler.err.default.allowed.in.intf.annotation.member
