During work for JDK-8049127 for creation of golden files, it was discovered that a new negative test can be added to have invalid annotations on packages on similar lines as existing test tools/javac/annotations/neg/Package.java. 

Test code: 
Test.java has reference to package bar. 
bar dir has a package-info.java which has java.lang.annotation.Documented annotation on package.bar.
