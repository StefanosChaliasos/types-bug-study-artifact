Following two tests have @ignore:

tools/javac/processing/model/type/BasicAnnoTests.java
com/sun/javadoc/testTypeAnnotations/TestTypeAnnotations.java

@ignore was added when these tests were brought over from type-annotations forest as part of 8026564.
The tests are failing with latest JDK9 binaries but do not have any open bug id listed with @ignore. 

Possible resolutions:
- Update the test to fix the errors or
- Add an open bug id in the @ignore line
