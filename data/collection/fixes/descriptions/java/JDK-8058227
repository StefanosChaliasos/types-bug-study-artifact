See issue https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=246528
In the attached project, when the debugger is suspended on line 7, no variables can be seen.
When we look into stack frame "155584260.process", there are two arguments under "this":
arg$1 = Main@383534aa
arg$2 = "test"
The second argument is actually a value of the desired "variable".
Please add the outer variables to the LocalVariableTable so that debuggers can access them.
