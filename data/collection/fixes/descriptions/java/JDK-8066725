Before fixing JDK-8065132, javac was producing incorrect number of entries in Runtime(In)VisibileParameterAnnotations classfiles attribute for non-static innerclasses and enums. After fixing the bug, the attribute is correct in these cases, but javac cannot read the classfiles anymore.

To reproduce, use the two attached files as a jtreg test: place them in the same directory and use jtreg to run ParamAnnotationsRead.java. The test will fail with:
---
.../ParamAnnotationsRead.java:6: error: cannot access Foo
import p.ParamAnnotationsWrite.Foo;
                              ^
  bad class file: .../p/ParamAnnotationsWrite$Foo.class
    bad RuntimeInvisibleParameterAnnotations attribute: Foo(int)
    Please remove or make sure it appears in the correct subdirectory of the classpath.
1 error
result: Failed. Compilation failed: Compilation failed
