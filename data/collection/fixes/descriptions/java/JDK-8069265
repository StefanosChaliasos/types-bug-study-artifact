As of JDK 9b08+ the following program when compiled and run
produces CCE. Earlier builds produce code that runs cleanly.

// ---- 8< ------
import java.util.*;
 
public class X {
    static interface Foo {
    }
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Date> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add(new Date());
 
        List<Foo> cList = (List<Foo>) (List<?>) list;
        Date date = (Date) cList.get(0);
    }
}

// ---- 8< ------

This new behavior got introduced as a result of the fix for
https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8015499 and
needs to be investigated.

Prima facie, there is no indication that there is a compiler bug here. The compiler
is well within its rights to assert what it is asserting which fails due to CCE. But
we may want to see if we should avoid such gratuitous and inadvertent behavior
change.
