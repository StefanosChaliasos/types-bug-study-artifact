This field was originally introduced to easily select between StringBuffer and StringBuilder. Since we no longer support target 1.6, this has become obsolete.

Also, since the field is initialized from Symtab, and Symtab is part of a cyclic dependency (Symtab -> ClassFinder -> ClassReader -> Annotate -> Check -> Resolve -> Symtab) the field is not always initialized properly.
