langtools/test/tools/javac/4846262/CheckEBCDICLocaleTest.java is failing.

It relies on being able to set the default charset used by javac, including use for System.out and System.err, and has been using -Dfile.encoding to do so.

javac does support a -encoding flag, but that is for source file encoding only, and is not a sufficient substitute.

This is a Tier 1 test failure.
