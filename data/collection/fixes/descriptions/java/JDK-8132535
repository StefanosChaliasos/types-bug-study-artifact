The following test cause compiler to fail.
Here qualified anonymous class instance creation expression with diamond is used.
Bound of enclosing class type parameter need to be intersection.

Minimal test case:

interface I {}
class C {}
class B extends C implements I {}

class Test <T extends C & I>{
    class A <T>{
        public A(T b) {
        }
    }
    public void foo(){
        A a = new Test<>().new A<>(new B()){} ;
    }
}

It was tested with jdk 9b68 and 9b74

The failing JCK tests are:
