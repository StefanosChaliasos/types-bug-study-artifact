The removal of sun.misc.Lock and a related type (JDK-8139307) has triggered three langtools test to fail as they refer to the removed types:

tools/javac/proprietary/WarnClass.java
tools/javac/warnings/6594914/T6594914b.java
tools/jdeps/APIDeps.java

Presumably another type in sun.misc could be used instead.
