The -i, -if, -x and -xf are...

1. Buggy: Sjavac accepts for instance "-xf foo/bar/*" and "-i */foo" even though the semantics is unclear. Seems to behave as a no-op.
2. Redundant: -i and -if overlap in functionality
3. Inconsistent: "*" behaves differently depending on location. -if treats it as a file glob pattern, and -i treats it as a directory glob pattern.

Suggested fix: Drop -if and -xf. Switch to proper glob pattern syntax, and use FileSystem.getPathMatcher.
