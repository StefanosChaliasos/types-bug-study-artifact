Consider the following

m1: explicit module
m2: automatic module
m3: explicit module

m1 requires m2

compile m1 with a reference to m3 and `-addmods m3`. The compilation succeeds. It seems that m2 has granted implied readability to m3 but it should not do this because m3 is an explicit module. 

At runtime then it fails as expected with IllegalAccessError.

I attach a zip file with a complete test case.
