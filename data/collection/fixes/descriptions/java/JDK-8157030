The developer build is broken since we upgraded classfile version - this is due to the fact that build tools are compiled with source/target 9, which then makes generated classes incompatible with the VM used to launch Ant.

In principle, this problem can be addressed by using JDK 9 to run Ant, but the common practice is to use JDK N-1 to run Ant.
