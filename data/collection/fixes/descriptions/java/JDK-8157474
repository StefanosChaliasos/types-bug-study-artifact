The ModuleWrappers class could be simplified by reducing the lazy reflective lookup to a single init() method per class.

In addition, the class should be renamed to JDK9Wrappers, partly to indicate the temporary nature of the class, and partly to allow the possibility of non-module API being supported in the class.
