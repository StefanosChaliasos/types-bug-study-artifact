This is a temporary umbrella issue for problems with javac localization and/or the diags/examples framework.

1. It would be good to provide a dedicated Ant script to make it easier to run the diags framework easily for all locales

2. The generated output should be HTML 5, charset UTF-8 (the current output for Asian locales does not display correctly

3. One message (invalid argument for -Xpatch option) ends up on the console, instead of in the output file (probably cause, wrong log inside JavacFileManager/Locations)
