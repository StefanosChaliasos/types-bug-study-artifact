
JavaFileManager is inconsistent in its use of the phrase "module location".

JavaFileManager.Location.isModuleLocation
    returns true for a module-oriented location, such as MODULE_PATH, UPGRADE_MODULE_PATH, etc.
    The description is accurate, even if the name is confusing.

JavaFileManager.getModuleLocation(<overloaded>)
    returns a package-oriented location for a specific module.
    The method should be called on a location for which Location.isModuleLocation is true;the result is one for which isModuleLocation should be false! Ouch.

JavaFileManager.listModuleLocations
    returns a series of package-oriented locations for individuial modules on a module path.
    The method should be called on a location for which Location.isModuleLocation is true; the result is a series of locations for which isModuleLocation should be false! Ouch.

isModuleLocation is about "module-oriented locations", such as module paths, containing possibly many modules;  the other two methods are about "locations for modules", meaning a package-oriented location for the contents of a specific module.

This causes significant confusion for users.
