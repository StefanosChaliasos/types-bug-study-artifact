The test

tools/javac/tree/TreePosTest.java

has been seen to fail intermittently (JDK-8162907) recently on test systems using the default JVM and -Xmx512m for memory. With a change in win32 from the C1 to C2 compiler (JDK-8154209), the C2 compiler seems to need more memory to run.

A workaround until the underlying issues are addressed (JDK-8143321), is to try to modify the jtreg options for this test.
