$ javac --inherit-runtime-environment T.java
error: cannot find module: ALL-DEFAULT
1 error

javac launcher sets --add-modules ALL-DEFAULT in the runtime environment but javac currently does not support ALL-DEFAULT token.

We should also check if any other options or tokens supported by the runtime is not currently supported by javac.
