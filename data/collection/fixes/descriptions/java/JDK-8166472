From Jim Gish:

Here's the simple case.

I have a file, jims.tags which has a single line:

    -tag jims.tag:optcmf:"Jim's Famous Tag"

When I separate that out and put it on the command line:

    javadoc pkg.test -sourcepath . -tag jims.tag:optcmf:"Jim's Famous Tag"

it all works fine.

However, when I try:

    javadoc pkg.test -sourcepath . @jims.tags

I get:

    javadoc: error - Illegal package name: "Jim's Famous Tag"
    Loading source files for package pkg.test...
    1 error

I've tried various things without success.  What's up?
