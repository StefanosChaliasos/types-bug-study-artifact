javac option decoding uses an Option class, with a "process" method to handle each option. For historical reasons, the method returns a boolean to indicate if the option was handled correctly or not. This makes it too easy to overlook a negative result, especially now that we are leveraging the javac code to handle javac-like options in other tools, like javadoc, including (specifically) all the new module-related options.

The boolean return code paradigm should be replaced by the use of (checked) exceptions to indicate an error while processing an option.
