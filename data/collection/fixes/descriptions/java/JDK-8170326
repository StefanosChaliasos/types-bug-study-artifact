A type-safe approach to invoke compiler diagnostics has been introduce to javac by means of the CompilerProperties. This relies on comments in compiler.properties that specify types of diagnostic parameters.

When working on an automatic convertor from existing invocations to the new system, it was discovered that in a number of cases the code, the messages in compiler.properties and comments in compiler.properties are not fully consistent.

The list of cases that should be investigated an possibly fixed is attached. All source files are relative to langtools/src/jdk.compiler.
