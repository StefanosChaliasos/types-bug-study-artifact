Compiling javac sources before JDK-8169197:
---
real    0m19.038s
user    0m56.852s
sys     0m1.516s

real    0m19.223s
user    0m57.044s
sys     0m2.100s
---

After the patch:
---
real    0m33.440s
user    1m22.244s
sys     0m2.164s

real    0m34.358s
user    1m22.336s
sys     0m2.296s

The problem is that the recovery search introduced by JDK-8169197 is running also for certain package lookups in valid sources, slowing down the compilation.
