It is suggested that we hide (or even remove) support for --inherit-runtime-environment which was added to JDK 9 in b132  JDK-8156998.

The dominant use case has gone away, and to the extent it remains, it may be better served by env variables and @files.

In addition, the option has become more complex, since it now has to filter specific option values, not just entire options.

For now, it is suggested that we undocument/hide the option.
