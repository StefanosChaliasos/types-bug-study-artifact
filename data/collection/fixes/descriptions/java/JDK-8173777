By updating --patch-module to accept source files, we can eliminate -Xmodule by folding that functionality into the --patch-module option.

This will have a derivative benefit for the javadoc tool as well, since the javadoc options for --patch-module and  -Xmodule simply and directly delegate to their javac equivalents.
