From Jon, in the AnnotationProcessing, this is printed:
Note: Multiple elements named {1} in modules {2} were found by javax.lang.model.util.Elements.getTypeElement.
Note: Multiple elements named {1} in modules {2} were found by javax.lang.model.util.Elements.getPackageElement.
Note: Multiple elements named {1} in modules {2} were found by javax.lang.model.util.Elements.getTypeElement.

Note: Multiple elements named {1} in modules {2} were found by javax.lang.model.util.Elements.getTypeElement.

Which is apparently wrong, should be:
Note: Multiple elements named 'impl.conflict.module.Impl' in modules 'm1x, m2x' were found by javax.lang.model.util.Elements.getTypeElement.
Note: Multiple elements named 'impl.conflict.module' in modules 'm1x, m2x' were found by javax.lang.model.util.Elements.getPackageElement.
Note: Multiple elements named 'impl.conflict.src.Impl' in modules 'm1x, unnamed module' were found by javax.lang.model.util.Elements.getTypeElement.
Note: Multiple elements named 'impl.conflict.src' in modules 'm1x, unnamed module' were found by javax.lang.model.util.Elements.getPackageElement.
Note: Multiple elements named 'impl.conflict.clazz.pkg' in modules 'm1x, m2x' were found by javax.lang.model.util.Elements.getTypeElement.
