In a private email conversation, it was noted that putting all of the source of a module on the patch module path for javadoc was reported as an error. But in similar circumstances, the runtime only gives a warning. 

javac should generally behave the same as the runtime in this situation.

javadoc output:

    error: module-info.class not allowed on patch path: /usr/**redacted**/jdk/src/jdk9/jdk/src/java.base/share/classes/module-info.java
