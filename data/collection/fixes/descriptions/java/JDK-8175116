The changes made under JDK-8166002 emulated the old client build in the win 32 environment with reduced address space. Before that change was made, several very stable langtools regression tests had high frequency intermittent failures, requiring updates to the tests to pass reliably again (JDK-8168499, JDK-8163999, JDK-8165193).

After JDK-8166002 was integrated, the test updates were reverted (JDK-8173305) and the failures were seen again, requiring the test updates to be reapplied (JDK-8174059).

Therefore, at least in some cases, the previous virtual address space behavior of the client compiler is not fully replicated.

From analysis, it was concluded that this is not emulated client issue.
This behavior is observed from 9b113, JDK-8152733 integration.
