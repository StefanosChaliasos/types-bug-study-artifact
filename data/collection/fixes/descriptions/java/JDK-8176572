Here is the quote from latest JLS 9: 

7.7. Module Declarations 
"In the declaration of a module name (after module) and in any use of a module name (by requires, exports, or opens), every identifier in the name must end with a Java letter, or a compile-time error occurs. " 

Compiler does not produce an error.

In cases when the last identifier ends with a digit compiler produces a warning.

Either the compiler should report an error or the spec should be less strict.
