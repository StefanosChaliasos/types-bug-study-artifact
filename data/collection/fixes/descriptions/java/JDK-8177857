The meaning of ALL-SYSTEM has been updated to its common-sense meaning and should mean "all system modules", meaning "all modules in the system image".

javac should follow suit.

Copied from JDK-8177805:

This issue might require looking at ALL-MODULE-PATH too, this should resolve all modules on the module path and should not cause incubator modules in the system image to be resolved.
