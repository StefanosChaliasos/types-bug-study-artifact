The methods 
StandardjavaFileManager.getLocation
StandardjavaFileManager.getLocationAsPaths
StandardjavaFileManager.setLocation
StandardjavaFileManager.setLocationFromPaths

all throw UnsupportedOperationException for MODULE_SOURCE_PATH because the underlying methods in Locations.ModuleSourcePathLocationHandler are no implemented. Now that we have implemented the more complex setLocationForModule method, it is reasonable to implement these simpler variants.
