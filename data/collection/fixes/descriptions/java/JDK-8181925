Download the attached testcase, unpack, fill a path to javac in "unname-reads/run.sh" and then run the script.

This will yield:
---
error: module  reads package api from both mb and ma
1 error
---

The module name is empty here, which is confusing. Should be like:
---
error: the unnamed module  reads package api from both mb and ma
1 error
---
