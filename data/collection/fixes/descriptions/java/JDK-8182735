This issue is an umbrella for several improvements to analyzers. Analyzers, also known as finders, have been executed after the tree to be analyzed has been attributed. More complex analyzers require not only type but also flow information. For this reason analyzers needs to be invoked after flow analysis has been performed on the tree.

Also the current analyzers framework is not flexible enough to allow for multiple mutations of the same analyzed tree. Currently they are working in an all or nothing approach. Due to this limitation some analyzers may produce suboptimal, sometimes erroneous, recommendations to users. The current framework should be improved.
