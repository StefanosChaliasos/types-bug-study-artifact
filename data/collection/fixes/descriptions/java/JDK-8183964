There seems to be a behavior change / bug in the javadoc tool in OpenJDK 9 relative to OpenJDK 8 when the backslash character \ occurs in javadoc.

For example, in java.io.File, the javadoc:

 *      directory, or <code>"\\\\"</code>&nbsp;for a Microsoft Windows UNC pathname, and

becomes [Java 8 docs]:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/File.html

   directory, or "\\\\" for a Microsoft Windows UNC pathname, and

vs. [Java 9 docs]:
http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/java/io/File.html

   directory, or "\\\" for a Microsoft Windows UNC pathname, and

(with an obvious and unintended change in meaning)

----

Where the \ appears at the end of the line, then the following line's '*' gets erroneously included in the .html. For example, in java.util.Properties, the javadoc:

     * fruits                           apple, banana, pear, \
     *                                  cantaloupe, watermelon, \
     *                                  kiwi, mango

becomes [Java 8 docs]
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html

 fruits                           apple, banana, pear, \
                                  cantaloupe, watermelon, \
                                  kiwi, mango
vs. [Java 9 docs]:
http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html

 fruits                           apple, banana, pear, \
     *                                  cantaloupe, watermelon, \
     *                                  kiwi, mango
