The following files are probably redundant/obsolete and can/should be removed.

langtools/src/jdk.jdeps/share/classes/com/sun/tools/javap/overview.html
langtools/src/java.compiler/share/classes/javax/lang/model/overview.html
langtools/src/java.compiler/share/classes/javax/tools/overview.html

The latter two were part of standalone doc-bundles. For javax.tools there is some content that could/should be folded into the java.compiler module docs.
