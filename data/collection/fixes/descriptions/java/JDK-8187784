Following the consolidated repo restructuring, an updated version of the langtools IntelliJ project has been release. This new project has broader exclusion settings, since a langtools developer will not, in general be interested in other sources, and as such it is preferrable not to have the IDE waste time on indexing external sources.

Unfortunately, excluding src/, test/ and make/ folders had an unexpected side-effect: VCS is no longer able to keep track of the changes occurring in such folders.
