When setLocationForModule is used, and then JavaFileManager.listLocationsForModules is used, then for (some locations), the listed locations won't include the changes through setLocationForModule. In particular the locations handled by Locations.ModulePathLocationHandler are affected, because it will list modules based on the searchPath and ignore the ModuleTable.
