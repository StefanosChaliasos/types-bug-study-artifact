import javafx.application.Application;
public class Testing {   public static void main(String... args) {}   }

$ javac Testing.java   // compile successfully

$ javac --release 8 Testing.java
it results in an error
        Testing.java:1:error: package javafx.application does not exist

It might be reasonable for javac --release 8 to require putting jfxrt.jar from JDK 8 on the classpath since it's target for an older runtime.

I think jdk10/bin/javac --release 9 should support compiling Testing.java.
