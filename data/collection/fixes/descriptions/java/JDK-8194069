FULL PRODUCT VERSION :
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_152"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_152-b16)

A DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM :
Running javac with -Xdoclint:all occasionally produces warnings about missing Javadoc comments on code which normally does not usually have (and in many cases cannot have) Javadoc. 


STEPS TO FOLLOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM :
javac -Xdoclint:all -Werror acme/MyClass.java


EXPECTED VERSUS ACTUAL BEHAVIOR :
EXPECTED -
No warnings emitted and command succeeds.
ACTUAL -
2 warnings are emitted, the first of them on the parameter to the lambda and the second on the local variable:



ERROR MESSAGES/STACK TRACES THAT OCCUR :
/.../acme/MyClass.java:16: warning: no comment
    static final Function<String, String> someFunction = string -> {
                                                         ^
/.../acme/MyClass.java:18: warning: no comment
        int localVariable = 3;
            ^
error: warnings found and -Werror specified
1 error
2 warnings


REPRODUCIBILITY :
This bug can be reproduced always.

---------- BEGIN SOURCE ----------
package acme;

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.function.Function;

/**
 * The class has docs.
 */
public final class MyClass
{
    /**
     * The field itself has docs.
     */
    // Spurious warning 1 here, at 'string ->'
    static final Function<String, String> someFunction = string -> {
        // Spurious warning 2 here, at 'localVariable'
        int localVariable = 3;
        return Integer.toString(localVariable);
    };
}

---------- END SOURCE ----------

CUSTOMER SUBMITTED WORKAROUND :
Not using doclint is a workaround, but we want to use it, because we'd like to report Javadoc issues as soon as possible.
