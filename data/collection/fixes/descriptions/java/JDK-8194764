After applying the attached patch, while compiling with the Intelij IDE or by using ant to build, javac emits errors for imports referencing Deprecated/forRemoval classes, however build the jdk images using make does not exhibit the problem. The bug here is that error at import sites cannot be
suppressed.

The theory is that it could be the ordering of files from returned by the  filesystem, although the issue seems to be reproducible on both Windows and Linux (OEL).
