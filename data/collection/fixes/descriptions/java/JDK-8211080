The test RawStringLiteralLangAPI.java routinely times out when I run it locally.

Looking at the code, it looks like it is a combo test that runs 36,000 test cases (compilations.)

Either it should execute fewer test cases, or it should be given an increased timeout.

It's also very noisy and writes out lots of text. The chances are the test is overflowing the
standard output limit for jtreg tests.  It should write less noise when all is going well.
