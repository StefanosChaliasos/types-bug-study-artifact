The below code should throw a compilation error as there is no result expression for the switch expression. However, the compilation goes through successfully.

public class SwitchTest {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws MyException {
        int i = 0;
        int a = switch (i) {
            default -> throw new MyException();
        };
        System.out.println(a);
    }

}

class MyException extends Exception {

}
