The below code should throw a compilation error as yield is used in incorrect context. However, the compilation goes through successfully.

interface TestIntf {
    void foo(int[] a);
}

public class SwitchTest {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TestIntf expr = (yield a) -> {
            System.out.println(a.length);
        };
        expr.foo(new int[]{12, 3, 45});
    }
}
