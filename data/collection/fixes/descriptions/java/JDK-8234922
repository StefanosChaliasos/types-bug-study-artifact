The below code uses instanceof in do S while(e) statement. It should throw a compilation error as S contains a reachable break statement whose break target contains S. However, the compilation goes through successfully.

public class PatternTest {
    static public Object b0 = "bb";

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String res = "";
        Object bx = b0;
        A:
        do {
            res += "t";
            break A;
        } while (!(bx instanceof String v));
        System.out.println("Got: " + v);
    }
}

There is a LinkageError thrown at runtime. The error log is attached below.
