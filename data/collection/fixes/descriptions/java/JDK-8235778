The below code declares a record in a local class. It should throw a compilation error as nested record type is implicitly static and inner class cannot have static members except for constant variables. However, the compilation goes through successfully.

class Outer {
    public void test() {
        class Inner extends Outer {
            record TestRecord(int i, int j) {            
            }
        }
    }
}
