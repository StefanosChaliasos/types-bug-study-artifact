Consider the following code sample:

public record R(Number number) {
   public Integer number() {
       return 42;
   }
}

When compiling it with jdk14b28

javac --enable-preview --release 14 R.java

the following error occurs:

R.java:2: error: invalid accessor method in record R
   public Integer number() {
                  ^
  (return type of accessor method number() is not compatible with type of record component number)
Note: R.java uses preview language features.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:preview for details.
1 error
============================================

However JLS update (http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~gbierman/jep359/jep359-20191125/specs/records-jls.html) says:
"If an accessor method is declared explicitly, then it must additionally satisfy the following rules; otherwise a compile-time error occurs:
    The return type of the accessor method must be identical to the declared type of the corresponding record component"

Compiler error message could be improved by replacing:
"is not compatible with type of record component number"
with
"is not identical to the declared type of the corresponding record component"
