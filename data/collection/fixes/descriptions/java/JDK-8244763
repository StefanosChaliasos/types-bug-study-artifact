The symbol table in javac in JDK 11+ needs to be updated with the new APIs introduced in JSR 337 MR3 (8u251/8u252).  

Both ALPN + RSASSA-PSS.

IIUC, these files are incremental which is fine for ALPN as the changes were introduced in JDK 9 (next release), but the PSS changes were added in 11, so they won't exist in JDK 9/10.
