the spec for sealed types [1] states:

It is a compile-time error if an annotation type declaration has the modifier sealed. The compiler is currently accepting this code:

public sealed @interface MyAnno {}

non-sealed interface Foo extends MyAnno {}

the compiler should be in sync with the spec.
