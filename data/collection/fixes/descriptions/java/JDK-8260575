https://github.com/openjdk/valhalla/pull/316 is a merge from mainline from mid-December to Jan 19th, there were very few merge conflicts outside of Hotspot, but yes the JDK version was flipped (which I assume is the root cause here)...

Noted a number of test compilation failures involving casts with reference projections. The following langtools tests also fail:

tools/javac/valhalla/lworld-values/BoxValCastTest.java
tools/javac/valhalla/lworld-values/CheckSync.java
tools/javac/valhalla/lworld-values/ConditionalInlineTypeTest.java
tools/javac/valhalla/lworld-values/ConditionalTypeTest.java
tools/javac/valhalla/lworld-values/GenericsAndValues5.java
tools/javac/valhalla/lworld-values/IntercastTest.java
tools/javac/valhalla/lworld-values/IntercastTest2.java
tools/javac/valhalla/lworld-values/ProjectionRelationsTest.java
