Consider code like:
---
public class Test {
    public static void main(String... args) {
        new Test().test("a");
    }
    private void test(String s) {
        if (s != null) {
            switch (s) {
                case "a":
                    System.out.println("a"); //breakpoint here, and continue with step-over
                    break;
                default:
                    System.out.println("default"); //the program counter will be shown here eventually
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("null");
        }
    }
}
---

Place a breakpoint at the marked line, and continue with step-over. After a few steps, the current program counter marker will be at the line:
System.out.println("default");

The line will not be executed, but it will appear as if it would in the debugger.
