In the following code the (if (withExt) fileRef.ext.startWith('.')) is missing an else clause but neither the compiler nor the kotlin plugin flag it as an error.

At runtime the missing else will result in "kotlin.Unit" being used when the condition of the `if` is false.

I pared down the code to the minimal that duplicates the lack of error.

{code lang=kt}
object MarkdownTestData {
    fun repoUrlFor(withExt: Boolean): String {
        return "" + (if (withExt) "")
    }
}
{code}

Removing the leading "" +  from the return does make the plugin and the parser highlight the error.
