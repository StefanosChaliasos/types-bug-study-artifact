The following method doesn't compile:

```
fun foo() {
    if (true) {
        when (true) {
            true -> println()
        }
    } else {
        System.out?.println()
    }
}
```

The compiler says that `when` requires an `else` branch. If you remove the `?` in `System.out?.println()`, the method compiles. I assume this has to do with `Unit?` not being treated specially. This seems related to https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-10191
