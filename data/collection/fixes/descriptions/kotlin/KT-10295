``` kotlin
sealed class Foo {
    class Bar : Foo()
    class Baz: Foo()
}

fun test(f: Foo) = when (f) {
    is Foo.Bar -> "" 
}
```

The current diagnostic is:

`'when' expression must contain 'else' branch`

(minor) "Contain" is wrong here, use "have"
(a lot more important) There's no information about which cases are missing
