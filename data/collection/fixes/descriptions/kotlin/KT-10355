Example:
{code lang=kt}
fun foo(vararg x1: Int, x2: Int) = println("foo #1")
fun foo(x1: Int, vararg x2: Int) = println("foo #2")

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    foo(x1 = 1, x2 = 2) // foo #1, should be an ambiguity
}
{code}

OverloadingConflictResolver treats a function as a "variable arity" if `vararg` is the last argument. 
In any other cases, vararg-specific overloading conflict resolution logic is not applied at all.

NB1: `vararg` is meaningful as not the last argument if the function accepts a trailing lambda argument, or has arguments with default values.
NB2: we do not prohibit declarations such as `fun foo(vararg x1: Int, vararg x2: Int)`; probably we should.
