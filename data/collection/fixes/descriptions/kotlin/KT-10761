E.g.:
Error:(12, 1) Kotlin: Property effective visibility 'public' should be the same or less permissive than its type effective visibility 'public/*package*/'

In case of inferred type (including generic types) it can be non-obvious. 
See, for example, comments to KT-10752, where we infer a type from some Java class hierarchy that turns out to be package-private.
