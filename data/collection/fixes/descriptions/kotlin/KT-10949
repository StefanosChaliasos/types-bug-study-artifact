Using IntelliJ IDEA 15.0.3 Community Edition
JRE: 1.8.0_75
JVM: OpenJDK 64 bit
OS: Manjaro Linux (Arch based) with Linux kernel 4.4
Kotlin plugin: 1.0.0-rc-1036-IJ143-43

Apparently this was fixed in KT-3131 and KT-2505 (both from 2012) but this error won't let me compile. Source and screenshot attached.

Error:(41, 23) Kotlin: Type mismatch: inferred type is T but T was expected

PS: is the same if I use this[i, j] and data[i][j]
