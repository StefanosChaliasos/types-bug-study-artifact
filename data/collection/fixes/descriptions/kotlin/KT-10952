log4j has two classes with log-level constants: `Priority` and `Level`. The latter is deprecated and recommends to use `Level` in the JavaDoc. The tricky thing is that `Level` *extends* `Priority` and redefines all of the constants. So for instance there's deprecated `Priority.DEBUG` and non-deprecated `Level.DEBUG`. 

Kotlin, however, marks both as deprecated (possibly, because of the inheritance relation). 

This behaviour is easily reproducible:

```
import org.apache.log4j.Level

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println(Level.DEBUG)
}
```
