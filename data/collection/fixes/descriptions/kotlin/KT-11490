Such declarations are already prohibited if intersection is at top-level
```
open class X
open class Y

fun foo1(x: Any?) = if (x is X && x is Y) x else null // Error: return type is X & Y
```

But following is not
```
interface In<in E> 
open class A : In<A>
open class B : In<B>

fun <T> select(x: T, y: T) = x

fun foo2() = select(A(), B()) // No error, but return type 'In<A & B>' contains intersection
```
