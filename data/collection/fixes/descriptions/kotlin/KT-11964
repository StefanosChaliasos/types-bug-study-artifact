For example, here TABLESWITCH is in use as expected

```
enum class Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE }
fun fifth(arg: Color) = when (arg) {
    Color.RED -> 1
    Color.GREEN -> 2
    Color.BLUE -> 3
}
```

but here TABLESWITCH suddenly disappears and we have chain of if (areEqual) instead

```
import Color.RED
enum class Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE }
fun fifth(arg: Color) = when (arg) {
    RED -> 1
    Color.GREEN -> 2
    Color.BLUE -> 3
}
```

Relevant suspicious place in resolve: ConstantExpressionEvaluator handles `Color.RED` as a constant, but it does not handle just `RED` as a constant.
