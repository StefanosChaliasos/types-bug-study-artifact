Given the following code:

{code:kotlin}
data class Foo(val bar: Boolean?)

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
  val f = Foo(true)
  if (f.bar != null) {
    if (f.bar!!) println("bar was true")
  }
}
{code}

Unfortunately the `!!` is required or the Kotlin compiler errors (see https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-8819). But IJ reports it as unnecessary:

When removing it, IJ correctly reports it as required:
