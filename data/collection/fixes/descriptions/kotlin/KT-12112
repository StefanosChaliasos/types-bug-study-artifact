```
fun test() {
    val x = Unresolved.foo ?: return
}
```

Besides an unresolved reference reported on `Unresolved`, there's also a warning
```
Elvis operator (?:) always returns the left operand of non-nullable type [ERROR : <ERROR PROPERTY TYPE>]
```
, which makes little sense and also leads to an unreachable code reported on `val x`.
