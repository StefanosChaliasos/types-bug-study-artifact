I've got :
```
java.lang.VerifyError: Bad invokespecial instruction: current class isn't assignable to reference class.
Exception Details:
  Location:
   (...)/ProjectRepository$listProjectInfo$1$2.set(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)V @8: invokespecial
  Reason:
    Error exists in the bytecode
  Bytecode:
    0x0000000: 2bc0 000f 2cc0 0024 b700 28b1          
```

I can't extract and publish the test case, but if there is a way to send the project privately, I will do so.
