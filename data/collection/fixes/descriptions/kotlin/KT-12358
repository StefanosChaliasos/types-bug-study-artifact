Consider the snippet:

```
abstract class Foo(manager: PsiManager, language: Language) : LightElement(manager, language), SyntheticElement {
    class Bar(manager: PsiManager, language: Language) : Foo(manager, language) 
}
```

It should not compiler, because `LightElement` has `abstract toString`, and `Bar` does not override it. 

However it compiles and fails with `AbstractMethodError` at runtime. Removing `SyntheticElement` marker interface from the super class list does cause the desired "class `Bar` must be declared abstract" error.
