``` kotlin
fun <T> foo(x : T?) {
    if(x is T) {
        println("Yes")
    }
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    foo<String>(null) // Prints "Yes", although null is not of type String
}
```

We should disallow using non-reified type-parameters in `is` operator, unless the type-parameter has bound `T : Any` or more restrictive, and the `is`-check can be replaced with `null`-check.
