Here `invoke` is called before the super call and INSTANCE_ACCESS_BEFORE_SUPER_CALL should have been reported:

```
open class C(val x: Int)

class D : C {
    constructor() : super(
            {
                ""()
                42
            }())

    operator fun String.invoke() { }
}
```

The problem is that we're reporting an error on a temporary fake element which was constructed for `invoke` resolution.
