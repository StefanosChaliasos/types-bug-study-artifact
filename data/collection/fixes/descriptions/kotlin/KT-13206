In case of suspicious operations with generics, report UNCHECKED_CAST instead (such operations do not provoke ClassCastException, at least at the point of casting). For example:

```
val x = 42
val y = x as String // CAST_NEVER_SUCCEEDS
val z = listOf(42)
val w = z as List<String> // UNCHECKED_CAST
```

To achieve that, we must check casts using classes, not types.
