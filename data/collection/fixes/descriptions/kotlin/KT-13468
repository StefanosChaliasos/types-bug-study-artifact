{color:red}Error: Type mismatch: inferred type is String? but String was expected{color}
```kotlin
fun foo(): String {
	var current: String? = null
	current = if (current == null) "bar" else current
	return current  // Error: Type mismatch: inferred type is String? but String was expected
}
```

{color:green}OK: Smart cast is working{color}
```kotlin
fun foo2(): String {
	var current: String? = null
	current = current ?: "bar"
	return current  // OK: Smart cast is working
}
```

Both cases should work normally.
