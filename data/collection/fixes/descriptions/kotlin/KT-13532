How to reproduce:

File 1:

private const val TYPE = "a"
annotation(TYPE)
class Test1

File2:

private const val TYPE = "b"
annotation(TYPE)
class Test2

This setup gives me an overload resolution ambiguity error. Resolution works normal if I use the const values outside of annotations. Files are in the same package.
