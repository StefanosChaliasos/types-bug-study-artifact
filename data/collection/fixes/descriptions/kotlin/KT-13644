Not enough information to infer the parameter

{code}
val notification = intent.getParcelableExtra("Some")  //error
{code}

*as* here should do the job becouse result type of whole expression is known
{code}
val notification = intent.getParcelableExtra("Some") as Notification //error
{code}

Also when type is specified error still occurs ('as Notification' is redundant but there should not be an error but warning)
{code}
val notification:Notification = i.getParcelableExtra(PollService.NOTIFICATION) as Notification  //error
{code}

Removing the 'as Notification' fixes error, but still above error is confusing
{code}
val notification:Notification = i.getParcelableExtra(PollService.NOTIFICATION) //ok
{code}
