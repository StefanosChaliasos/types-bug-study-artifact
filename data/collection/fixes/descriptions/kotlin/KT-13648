When writing tests for Kotlin interfaces/classes that involve Mocks, I often have to do the following to work around the fact that most of the Mockito methods such as any return null:

{code:lang=kotlin}
whenever(foo.getBar(any() ?: "")).thenReturn("ok")
{code}

This produces the warning "Elvis operator (?:) always returns the left operand of non-nullable type (???..???)", which is not correct, as any() returns null, and not working around it with the above trick will actually result in a test failure due to the Kotlin null checks.

Project with test case that triggers the warning:
