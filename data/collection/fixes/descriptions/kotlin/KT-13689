When "optimize imports" is invoked on the following code
```
import kotlin.Any

fun foo(): Any  {
    throw UnsupportedOperationException()
}
```

The import to `java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException` is inserted, however it shouldn't because it's a type alias imported by default from `kotlin` package.

It happens because `CollectUsedDescriptorsVisitor` observes constructor of type alias having `importableFqName` of the original type and not its alias.
