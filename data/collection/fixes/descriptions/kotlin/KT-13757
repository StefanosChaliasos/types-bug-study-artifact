If you make a jar from the following structure
```
package abc
class A {
    class Iter {}
}
```

And then use the jar in another project, it's possible to use nested class by it's fq-name `A$Iter`
```
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    abc.`A$Iter`() // OK
}
```

There will be unresolved reference in the IDE, but it works on the CLI compiler
