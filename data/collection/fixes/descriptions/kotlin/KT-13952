```kotlin
interface IA {
    fun foo(): Number
}

interface IB : IA {
    override fun foo(): Int
}

object AImpl : IA {
    override fun foo() = 42
}

open class C : IA by AImpl, IB

class D : C() {
    override fun foo(): Double = 3.14
}
```

Here signature for `foo` in `C` is taken from `IA` (thus override in `D` is considered correct).
However, it fails with CCE at run-time.
