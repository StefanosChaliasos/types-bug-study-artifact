Set a breakpoint anywhere in Kotlin code. Set "evaluate and log" to the following Kotlin expression:

```
Thread.currentThread().name
```

Observe that this accesses the private `Thread.name` field (which has type `char[]`) rather than `Thread.getName()` (which has type `String`).

Same for breakpoint expressions.
