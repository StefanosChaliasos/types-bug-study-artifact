```
@Target(AnnotationTarget.EXPRESSION)
annotation class Ann
fun foo(y: IntArray) {
    @Ann y[1] = 1 // user should choose between newline after annotation and wrapping `@Ann y[1]` into parentheses
}
```

Otherwise, due to different parsing rules with and without new line such expression is very confusing
