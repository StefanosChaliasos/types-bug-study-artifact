```kotlin
abstract class AFoo
interface IBar

typealias A1 = AFoo
typealias A2 = IBar

class C : A1(), A2
```

In supertype list for `C`:
- supertype constructor call `A1()` is resolved to constructor for `AFoo` (instead of type alias constructor for `A1`) - *problem*;
- supertype reference `A2` is resolved to `A2` (OK).

As a side effect, renaming `A1` doesn't rename corresponding reference in supertype list for `C`.
