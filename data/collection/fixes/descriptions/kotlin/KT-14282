{code:title=test.kt}
package test

typealias Foo = String
{code}

This code compiles with the following command:
```
$ kotlinc -language-version 1.0 test.kt
```

However, an error "type aliases are not supported" is expected. Note that this happens only when `Foo` is not used in the source code, and I suspect it has something to do with lazy resolution.
