I am attempting to use Apace Spark in a Kotlin (gradle) project. The performance of code completion is fairly low for Apache Spark code completion but when I attempt to do anything with SQLContext.udf(), such as register a UDF of my own. It deadlocks IntelliJ and it must be forced quit.

This has been observed on both the latest version of IntelliJ 15 Ultimate and the latest IntelliJ 2016.2 CE.
Mac OS X Sierra
Java 1.8.0_45-b14

Here is the snippet that is causing the issue. When I attempt to register the UDF ont eh SQLContext it locks up:

```kotlin
        val endAngleFunc = { arcMeasure: Double, startAngle: Double, value: Double, max: Double ->
            val p = value / max
            arcMeasure * p + startAngle
        }

        val endAngleUdf = udf(endAngleFunc, DataTypes.DoubleType)
        // sqlContext.udf().register("" Deadlock at this point
```
