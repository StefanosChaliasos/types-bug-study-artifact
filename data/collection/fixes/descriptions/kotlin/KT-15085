Here is a code snippet simplified from a larger piece of code

```
    fun count() {
        var cnt = 0
        count@ while (true) {
            cnt++
            if (cnt > 10) break@count  // ERROR: The label '@count' does not denote a loop
        }
    }
```

Just spent 15 minutes trying to figure out what's going on, bacause IDEA clearly highlights both `count@` and `@count` with the same label color and it is not clear why break should resolve to a function name at all. You cannot break out of function!
