After upgrading to M04 I have to explicitly add `Unit` as the last line to lot of `async {...}` blocks. I believe it's a bug. Consider following code:
```
fun qwe_coroutines_unit() {
    fun foo() {}
    fun bar(): Int = 123

    val x: Unit = run { // Compiles OK, as it figures out that result of `bar` should be just ignored
        foo()
        bar()
    }

    val p: CompletableFuture<Unit> = async { // Error: ...inferred type is CompletableFuture<Int>, but CompletableFuture<Unit> was expected
        foo()
        bar()
        // Unit <-- I don't want to add this thing all over the place
    }
}
```
