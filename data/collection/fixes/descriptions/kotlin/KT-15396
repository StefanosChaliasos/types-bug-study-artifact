Again, worked in M03, stopped to work in M04. I believe type inference for coroutines can (should) be improved.

```
private fun qwe_1() {
    fun <T> g(): T = 123 as T // Implementation doesn't matter here...

    fun <T> f(): CompletableFuture<T> = async {
        g() // Error: Not enough information to infer parameter T in fun <T> g()
        // g<T>() // This works. But above line worked in 1.1-M03
    }
}
```
