Using *1.0.6* or *1.1-M04* in an Android project with this dependency:

```gradle
compile 'com.leanplum:Leanplum:1.3.1'
```

I can never successfully build because of this error:

```text
e: Supertypes of the following classes cannot be resolved. Please make sure you have the required dependencies in the classpath:
    class com.leanplum.ActionContext, unresolved supertypes: d
```

Note that this works perfectly with *1.0.5-2* or *1.1-M03*.
