```kt
class MyClass(myArg: Any) {
    val arg
        get() = myArg
}
```

successfully compiles to

```js
function MyClass(myArg) {
}
Object.defineProperty(MyClass.prototype, 'arg', {
  get: function () {
    return myArg;
  }
});
```

which leads to a runtime error when trying to access `MyClass(anything).arg`

What's weird is that if we add a type annotation, we get a compile error (as we should, I guess):

```kt
class MyClass(myArg: Any) {
    val arg : Any
        get() = myArg
                ^ Unresolved reference: myArg
}
```
