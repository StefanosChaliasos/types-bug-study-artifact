I've declared the following ''infix'' function:
```
infix fun Int.mod(that: Int) = (this.rem(that) + that).rem(that)
```

Note that when called in infix form it takes precedence over `Int.mod` member.

Now when I invoke it with constant operands, like `val r = (-1) mod 5`, the constant folding simplifies this expression as if it had the builtin `mod`, producing an incorrect result `val r = -1`
