02:47:18.189 [ERROR] [system.err] /Users/yan/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/com.android.databinding/compiler/2.2.3/ad2f73c8ad3e820ea8a58ab61bdd20feb1ce1a8e/compiler-2.2.3.jar: error: runtime JAR file has version 1.0 which is older than required for language version 1.1
{code}

Looks like {{compiler-2.2.3.jar}} is added automatically by the Android plugin when the "data binding" feature is enabled in {{build.gradle}}. And {{compiler-2.2.3.jar}} contains code written in Kotlin 1.0.

I've tried to suppress the error by adding {{-Xskip-runtime-version-check}} as a work-around, but I was blocked by KT-15994.
