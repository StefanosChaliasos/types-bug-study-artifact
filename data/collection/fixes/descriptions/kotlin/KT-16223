{code}
    fun bar() {
        inline fun foo() {
        }
    }
{code}

Actual: the entire text of the function is reported as "construction is not yet supported in inline functions", the entire function is highlighted.

Expected: only the "inline" keyword is highlighted with message "Inline local functions are not yet supported"
