They seem to be unusable since they can't be properly initialized, at least for now 
```
class A {
    inner sealed class B {
        object O : B() // objects inside inner classes look like an error
        inner class W : B() // W can't be instantiated, because its' constructors needs an instance of B
    }

    inner class U : B() // subclasses of a non-top-level sealed class must be declared inside the class (see the KEEP https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/master/proposals/sealed-class-inheritance.md)
}
```
