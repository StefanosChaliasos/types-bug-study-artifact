For code
```
fun foo(x: String?) {}

class Test {
    // override fun equals(other: Any?) = super.equals(other)
}

fun bar(i: Test?) {
    if (i == null) foo(i)
}
```
depending if equals() is present or not, compiler disallows or allows smartcast, while it's expected that null check doesn't involve
equals() invocation.
