The following code no longer works in 1.1.0, however it worked in 1.0.6
```
private const val DURATION = 250L
class Foo {
    var bar: Long = 0

    constructor(value: Long) {
        /** ... **/
    }

    init {
        bar = DURATION
    }
}
```

The error I receive is "Cannot access DURATION; it is private in file", however if I modify the code to 

```
private const val DURATION = 250L
class Foo {
    var bar: Long = 0

    init {
        bar = DURATION
    }
}
```

Then the compiler no longer complains. Additionally, if I reference `DURATION` inside of the secondary constructor or in some property's initialization, it does not complain in either code snippet.
