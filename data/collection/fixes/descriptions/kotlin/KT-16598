Upgrading my IDE plugin to 1.1 and then trying to compile Corda master (github.com/corda/corda) fails due to the above error on code like the following:

`val signatureFutures = transactions.map { rpc.startFlow(NotaryFlow::Client, it).returnValue }`

Here NotaryFlow::Client is a class reference, and what the function expects is a constructor. This works in 1.0 OK, so I guess the feature check is too aggressive.

The code is available here:

https://github.com/corda/corda/blob/master/samples/raft-notary-demo/src/main/kotlin/net/corda/notarydemo/NotaryDemo.kt#L80

The declaring code is structured like this:

```
object X {
    class Y {
        companion object {}
    }
}
```
