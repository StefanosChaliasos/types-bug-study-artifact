Consider the following code:
{code}
class User {
    val address: String = "initial"
        get() {
            field = "changed"

            return field
        }
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println(User().address)
}
{code}

This will modify the address upon access.
I can reproduce this with both kotlin 1.0.5 and 1.1.0-rc91 (using IntelliJ plugin 1.1.0-release-IJ2017.1-1).

The "Kotlink in action" book says on page 85:
"In a getter, you can only read the value; and in a setter, you can both read and modify it."

Therefore the code above looks like a bug to me.
