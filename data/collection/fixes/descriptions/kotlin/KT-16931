This is a re-open of KT-12664.  Unfortunately the problem still persists in Kotlin 1.1.1.

You can reproduce with the following snippet:
```kotlin
import jenkins.model.ParameterizedJobMixIn.ParameterizedJob

val x: ParameterizedJob? = null
```

```
e: Supertypes of the following classes cannot be resolved. Please make sure you have the required dependencies in the classpath:
    class jenkins.model.ParameterizedJobMixIn.ParameterizedJob, unresolved supertypes: Task
```

You can use the same sample from the previous issue to reproduce:

(Just change pom.xml and bump kotlin.version to 1.1.1)
