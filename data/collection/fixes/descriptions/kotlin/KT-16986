Following set up does not compile

```
//common: 
header fun builderfoo(b: StringBuilder)

// jvm
impl fun builderfoo(b: StringBuilder) {}

// js
impl fun builderfoo(b: StringBuilder) {}
```

Same happens with parameter type `Regex` (which is header + impl) or `KotlinVersion` (which is common class)
