Unary minus with zero-valued expression produces irrelevant warnings
```kotlin
    println(-0) //Warning: Kotlin: This operation has led to an overflow
    println(-0L) //Warning: Kotlin: This operation has led to an overflow
    val i = 0
    println(-i) //Warning: Kotlin: This operation has led to an overflow
    val l = 0
    println(-l) //Warning: Kotlin: This operation has led to an overflow
    println(-(1-1)) //Warning: Kotlin: This operation has led to an overflow
```
