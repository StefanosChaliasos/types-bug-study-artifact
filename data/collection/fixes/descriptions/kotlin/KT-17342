- On 10000 variables analysis works for 22 seconds (more results (https://github.com/dzharkov/kotlin-compiler-benchmarks/blob/master/reports/benchmarks-many-vars-14-03-2017.json))
- Profiling shows that a lot of time is spent in GC 
After debugging it's recovered that control-flow works nearly O(n * m) where n is pseudocode size and m is a number of variables. 
    - It seems to be reasonable
    - The algorithm performs O(n) copies of hashmap of size O(m) that leads to GC overflow
    - It could be reasonable to use some kind of persistent map to avoid copying
