I have code like this:

```
private val openSessions = ConcurrentHashMap<Long, FlowSession>()

openSessions.values.removeIf { session -> ... }
```

This used to work. However, now openSessions.values is not detected as being mutable and so removeIf is flagged by the IDE (but oddly not during compile time) as unknown. If I add a cast to MutableCollection then the IDE is happy but, of course, tells me that the cast is unnecessary.
