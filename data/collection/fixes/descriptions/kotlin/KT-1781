I have a Java class with two constructors (in a library I dont' control):

{code}
public JavaClass() { ... }

public JavaClass(String... ss) { ... }
{code}

I want to call the first empty constructor from Kotlin. When I try, I get this message:

{code}
Overload resolution ambiguity: .....
{code}

I can't figure out a way to call that constructor.
