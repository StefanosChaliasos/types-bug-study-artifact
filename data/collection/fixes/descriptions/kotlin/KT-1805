{code}
open class Some {
    private val privateField = 12
}

class SomeSubclass : Some() {
    fun test() {
        this.privateField // 1. Unresolved reference
    }
}

fun test() {
    val s2 = Some()
    s2.privateField // 2. Can't access to 'privateField' in Some

    val s1 = SomeSubclass()
    s1.privateField // 3. Unresolved reference
}
{code}

All cases are very similar and have same reason of compile error so should have same description.
