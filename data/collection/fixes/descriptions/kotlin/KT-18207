Code 
```kt
fun foo() {
    var b : Any = 0
    fun bar() {
        b = 42
        println(b)  //Error:(7, 17) Kotlin: Smart cast to 'Int' is impossible, because 'b' is a local variable that is captured by a changing closure
    }
}
```
Compile error in the comment. Actually here smart cast is not expected. 
*Important*: code works fine in 1.1.2, fail in 1.1.4 (tried 469-518)
