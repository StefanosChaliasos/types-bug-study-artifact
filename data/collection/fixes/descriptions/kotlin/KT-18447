Consider Kotlin code:
{code}
header class HeaderClassWithFuns{ // (1)
    fun funInClass() // (2)
}

// another module, another file
impl class HeaderClassWithFuns // (3){code}

At this case at the line (3) there is following error:
{code}Modifier 'impl' is only applicable to members that are initially declared in platform-independent code{code}

But it would be better to emit here something like "missing method implementation ... "
