Consider Kotlin code:
{code}
header class HeaderClassWithFuns{ // (1)
    fun funInClass()
}

// another module
impl class HeaderClassWithFuns {
    fun funInClass(){} // (2)
} 
{code}

Now IDEA doesn't show any problem at any side
but compilation fails with error about header class (line (1)):
{code}e: C:\vshirunova\projects\issues\multitarget_01\m_common\src\main\kotlin\headers\classes\ClassWithFuns.kt: (8, 14): Header declaration 'HeaderClassWithFuns' has no implementation in module 
The following declaration is incompatible because some members are not implemented:
    public final impl class HeaderClassWithFuns
No implementations are found for members listed below:

    public final header fun funInClass(): Unit

    The following declaration is incompatible because the implementation is not marked with the 'impl' modifier (-Xno-check-impl):
        public final fun funInClass(): Unit{code}

Please show error something like "The declaration is incompatible because the implementation is not marked with the 'impl' modifier (-Xno-check-impl)" at line with method implementation (line (2))
