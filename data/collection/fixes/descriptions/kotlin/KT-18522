I am using 1.1.2-5 with Android Studio 3.0 Canary 4 and gradle plugin 3.0.0-alpha4, all of which are the latest at the time of writing. 
This issue popped up after updating gradle and AS, which is odd; it seems like quite a kotlin-specific error. 

There is something about this code that Kotlin doesn't like:

```
if (existingItem == null) {
                    Timber.v("Storing new app: ${appInfo.packageName}")
                    db.data.insert(appInfo)
                } else {
                    merge(from = appInfo, to = existingItem)
                    Timber.v("Updating existing app: ${existingItem.packageName}")
                    db.data.update(existingItem)
                }
```

I will attempt to fix it - it may well be related to **Requery** - but regardless I don't think that we ever want the compiler throwing an internal error, hence this report.
