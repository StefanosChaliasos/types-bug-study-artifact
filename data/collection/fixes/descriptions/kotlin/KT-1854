In the following code front-end says that 'foo' in 'TraitImpl' overrides nothing and 'TraitImpl' has unimplemented members. While debugging, i found that the problem happens when comparing two "{Runnable & Cloneable}" types for equality. Typechecker says that they are not equal, while they obviously are.

I also recommend considering case when upper bounds are reordered in overriding member

{code}trait Trait {
    fun <T : Runnable> foo() where T : Cloneable;
}

class TraitImpl : Trait {
    override fun <T : Runnable> foo() where T : Cloneable {
    }
}{code}
