As a follow up of KT-10942 and after discussing KT-19303 with @yole after the blog post I wrote (https://spring.io/blog/2017/08/01/spring-framework-5-kotlin-apis-the-functional-way), it seems Spring `@NonNullApi` and `@Nullable` annotations are currently supported only when JSR 305 JAR (for example the finbugs one) is on the project classpath.

For Spring Framework 5, the fact to detect them reflectively (doable since `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)`  is used on both Spring and JSR 305  annotations) is mandatory since we can't ask developers to rely on a dormant and unofficial JSR directly (I think we discussed that via Slack even if I can't find direct mention on Youtrack). Such capability is one of the reasons why we accepted to start this huge work on annotating the whole Spring Framework API to make it null-safe from Kotlin (and Java) POV so it is very important in the context of Spring framework 5 upcoming release.
