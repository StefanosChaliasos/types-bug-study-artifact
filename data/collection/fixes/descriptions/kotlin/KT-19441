IDEA 172.3544.35 + Kotlin IDE plugin / kotlin-gradle-plugin 1.2-M2-eap-26.
Create new Gradle based project with Kotlin.
Due to Kotlin IDE plugin version it is created with language level == API level == 1.2.

Dummy source:
{code:lang=kotlin}
annotation class ParArray(val p1: Array<String>)
@ParArray(arrayOf("a", "b")) class AnnotatedA
// @ParArray(["a", "b"]) class AnnotatedB {code}

Build the project: success.
Uncomment the array literal usage, rebuild: fail:
> Error:(5, 11) Kotlin: Collection literal call 'arrayOf()' is unresolved. Ensure you have the standard Kotlin library in dependencies

Same effect when building with JPS and with Gradle.

However, my old non-Gradle based project with collection literals is built with no problems.
