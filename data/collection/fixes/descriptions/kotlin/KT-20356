Same error appears in 1.1.50-eap-28 and 1.1.50-eap-18

You should probably fix this soon - looks like I had to waste many hours just because I made something private.. :)
```
// C.kt
open class C<T> {
    private var foo: String = "abc"
}
```
```
// B.kt
object B : C<String>() {

}
```
```
// A.kt
import B.foo
```
