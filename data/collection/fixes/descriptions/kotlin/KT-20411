I have tested Kotlin 1.1.50  with my Spring applications like [MiXit|https://github.com/mixitconf/mixit], and I am quite puzzled because JSR 305 null-safety introduced via KT-10942 and updated via KT-19419 seems not taken in account anymore!

I suspect the issue is mainly in IDEA Kotlin plugin 1.1.50  since for both following configuration null-safety is not taken in account:
 - project configured with Kotlin `1.1.4-3` , JSR 305 JAR in the classpath and `-Xjsr305-annotations=enable`  option
 - project configured with Kotlin `1.1.50` , JSR 305 not in the classpath and `-Xjsr305=strict`  option

When I say "null-safety not taken in account", it is because IDEA show all types as platform types, see attached screenshot where inferred type should be `HttpStatus?`  not `HttpStatus!`  since it is annotated with `@Nullable`.

If this regression is confirmed, we would appreciate a quick fix since we are releasing Spring 5 with null-safety as a key feature on September 28.
