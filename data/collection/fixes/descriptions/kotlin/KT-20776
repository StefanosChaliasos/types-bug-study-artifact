Having a class implementing annotation:
```
public @interface MyAnnotation {
}
public class MyAnnoClass implements MyAnnotation {
//...
}
```

In Kotlin 1.2 I can't perform an assigment:
```
val ann: MyAnnotation = MyAnnoClass()
```
getting a "Type Mismatch" error.

But it was possible with Kotlin `1.1.52`
