{code}
fun <T> lock(callback: () -> T): T =
    try {
        callback()
    } finally {
    }

var count = 0

fun foo() =
    lock {
        count += 1 // ASSIGNMENT_TYPE_MISMATCH
    }
{code}

If function ends with statement, type should be inferred as Unit.

Last statement could be even variable or function declaration, as in this code:

{code}
fun foo() =
    lock {
        val inc = 1
        //count += inc // disable increment temporarily
    }
{code}
