Starting from kotlin release 1.1.60, if a module has the maven dependency to xml-apis:xml-apis:1.0.b2, it won't recognize textContent-property (or getTextContent()) on org.w3c.dom.Node (implemented as com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.dom.DeferredElementImpl).

See attached sample project to recreate. Remove dependency to xml-apis to make compile. Code runs fine in intellij, so dependency resolving is apparently different.
