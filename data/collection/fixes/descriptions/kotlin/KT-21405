Create gradle-based project with Kotlin (JavaScript). Create Kotlin file with this code:
{code:lang=Kotlin|title=Foo.kt}fun sayGoodBye(name: String) = "Good bye ${name.toUpperCase()}"
{code}

Put caret inside string literal and edit it again and again. It's not 100 % reproducible but occurs very often in acceptance test on every IDE. I can show if needed.
Don't believe stack trace: my caret was inside literal, not after method name.
