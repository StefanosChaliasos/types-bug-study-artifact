From https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/annotations.html#annotation-use-site-targets:

> To annotate the receiver parameter of an extension function, use the following syntax:
> ```
> fun @receiver:Fancy String.myExtension() { }
> ```

When I type this into IDEA, I get the following warning:

> Use of this annotation with target 'type' and use site target '@receiver' is deprecated
