The simplest demonstration is with two Kotlin files like this:
```
package something

typealias T = N
object N
```

```
import something.T

class Test() {
    init {
        T.hashCode()
    }
}
```

Intellij Inspection now reports that the import in the second file is unused, so that after import cleanup it is removed, which obviously leads to an error. 
This happens whenever I import a typealias to an object and then only refer to its methods.
