While anonymous suspending functions are currently not supported (KT-18346), it is still allowed to pass an anonymous function as a suspending one if it does not call any other suspending functions:

    buildSequence<Int>(fun SequenceBuilder<Int>.(): Unit {
        println("Hello")
    })

The sample above is successfully compiled and fails at runtime:

    java.lang.ClassCastException: AKt$main$1 cannot be cast to kotlin.jvm.functions.Function2

It should probably be prohibited until KT-18346 is resolved.
