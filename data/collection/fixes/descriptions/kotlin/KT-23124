What steps will reproduce the issue?
1. Create a Gradle project with 3 modules, 1 with the `kotlin-platform-common` plugin, 2 with the `kotlin-platform-jvm` plugin, 3 with the `kotlin-platform-js` plugin as explained in this page: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multiplatform.html
2. In the module 1 (common), add a file Decimal.kt with `expect class Decimal`. in module 2 (jvm), add a file Decimal.kt `actual typealias Decimal = BigDecimal`. In module 3 (js), add a file Decimal.kt with `actual typealias Decimal = Double`
3. In module 1 (common) add a class like `class Foo(val bar: Decimal)`. In module 2 try to instantiate `Foo` with a `BigDecimal`, like `Foo(BigDecimal(1))`.

What is the expected result?

IntelliJ will not raise any compilation issues.

What happens instead?

Error: `Type mismatch. Required: Decimal. Found: BigDecimal` in `Foo(BigDecimal(1))`.

Building from the command line with Gradle works as expected, even though IntelliJ marks the line as having an error.
