{code}
fun Any?.baz() = 1

fun foo(l: Long?) = l?.baz() // UNNECESSARY_SAFE_CALL is reported here
{code}

Although 'baz' is applicable to 'l', I do not want to call it on null. Use case:

{code}
fun foo(l: Long?) = l?.toString() ?: "NULL" // to return "NULL" for "null"
{code}

This safe call cannot be called "unnecessary", because replacing "?." with "." changes behavior.
