kotlin common module:
```
expect enum class _TimeUnit
```

jvm platform module:
```
actual typealias _TimeUnit = java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit
```

error:
The following declaration is incompatible because modality is different:
    public final expect enum class _TimeUnit : Enum<_TimeUnit>

looking at other similar issues , "incompatible because modality is different" suggests that some final members are considered incompatible. I have tried listing methods and members on the common module with no luck.
Also since jvm TimeUnit implements Serializable and Comparable<TimeUnit> I tried to introduce those expect interfaces, but it didn't solve the issue.

kotlin version: 1.2.30
