# Synopsis

Type of change:
- New diagnostics: errors

Motivation:
- Compiler generates unobvious bytecode

Impact:
- Some code that used to compile wonâ€™t compile anymore

Migration:
- All code locations affected by this change can be accurately detected statically
- Migration can't be automated

# Existing behavior/pattern/bug

#### Code sample

```kotlin
interface Foo

annotation class Ann

class E : @field:Ann @get:Ann @set:Ann @setparam:Ann Foo 
```

Such annotations are meaningless, and are not present in the bytecode.

#### Affected version

This problem exists since Kotlin 1.0. 

# Proposed behavior/pattern
Meaningless target prefix for annotation on a supertype list element should be an error (as it is in other cases).

# Impact of this change
Since this code is meaningless, and corresponding annotations are not present in the bytecode in any form except Kotlin compiler metadata, it's safe to assume that this code pattern is extremely rare (if ever present in the real-life code).

# Migration 

- Report warning in 1.3.x
   - Report error in progressive mode
Corrected code will work and compile fine in a regular (non-progressive) mode
- Turn the warning into an error in 1.4
