The code:
```
import org.junit.Test

fun <T> bar(i: T): T = i
fun foo(i: Int) = i

fun dontRun(body: () -> Unit) = Unit

class Case1 {
   @Test
   fun test() {
       dontRun { val x = bar(bar { -> bar { -> 2} }) }
   }
}
```

The error (1.2.41 with -Xnew-inference):
```
[ERROR] /home/belyaev/kotlin-spec-tests/src/test/kotlin/org/jetbrains/kotlin/spec/inference/Case1.kt:[13,44] Type mismatch: inferred type is () -> Int but Nothing was expected
[ERROR] /home/belyaev/kotlin-spec-tests/src/test/kotlin/org/jetbrains/kotlin/spec/inference/Case1.kt:[13,44] Type mismatch: inferred type is () -> TypeVariable(_L) but Nothing was expected
```

Without -Xnew-inference everything works fine.
