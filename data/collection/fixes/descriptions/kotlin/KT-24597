Paste the following code into a common module of MPP:
{code lang=Kotlin}
expect open class A
open class C : A
{code}
â€” editor doesn't show any errors. Implement the needed `A` parts in platform modules, try to build the project. Build fails on `compileKotlin2Js` (which also seems to be strange) task with `This type has a constructor, and thus must be initialized here` pointing to the common module code given above.
