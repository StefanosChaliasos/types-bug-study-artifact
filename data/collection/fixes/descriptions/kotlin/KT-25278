Make sure you have contracts/effects system enabled in your compiler.

Dummy Kotlin:
```
fun useReturnImplies3(operated: Any?) {
    assertNotNull(operated)
    println(operated.hashCode()) // Error, no smart cast.
    assertNotNull(operated, "Dummy message.")
    println(operated.hashCode()) // No error, smart cast.
}

fun useReturnImplies4(operated: Any?) {
    assertNotNull(operated, block = {})
    println(operated.hashCode()) // Error, no smart cast.
    assertNotNull(operated, "Dummy message.", {})
    println(operated.hashCode()) // No error, smart cast.
}
```

Smart cast does not occur when default String argument is omitted.
But it's hard to see a reason behind that, since both calls in every case are resolved to the same function.
