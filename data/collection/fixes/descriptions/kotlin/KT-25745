```
annotation class Anno

class Statics {
    companion object {
        @JvmStatic
        @get:Anno
        @set:Anno
        var x2 = "" // currently there is a warning
    }
}
```

We shouldn't report warning on such cases because getter/setters are generated successfully and have annotations. 
There is a problem that we can't get annotations via Kotlin reflection, but this is a separate problem (KT-25499)
