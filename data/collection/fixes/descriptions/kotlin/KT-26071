Consider the following situation:
```kotlin
class A {
  fun foo(x: UInt) {} // (1)
}

fun A.foo(x: Int) {} // (2)

fun test() {
  A().foo(42)
}
```


Because of several design questions (KT-25996) we plan to report an error on `foo(42)`, but resolve the corresponding call to a member function (1).
This is needed to gradually introduce conversions later.
