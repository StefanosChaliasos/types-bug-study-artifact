With all necessary compiler flags provide some experimental API marker:
```
package feature.experimental.add

@Experimental annotation class LocalMarker
```

Refer to it from `@UseExperimental` with full qualified name:
```
@UseExperimental(feature.experimental.add.LocalMarker::class)
fun someFun() {}
```

Both compiler and IDE report EXPERIMENTAL_MARKER_CAN_ONLY_BE_USED_AS_ANNOTATION_OR_ARGUMENT_IN_USE_EXPERIMENTAL error:
> Error:(1, 49) Kotlin: This class can only be used as an annotation or as an argument to @UseExperimental

But why?
NB: Using import statement + short name is accepted.
NB: Using FQN in regular annotation is accepted.
