This expression is broken in 1.2.70, but worked previously.

```kotlin
const val TAU = 2.0 * PI
```

It seems the issue is from using `kotlin.math.PI` (or any other constant in `kotlin.math`)

```kotlin
const val ONE = 1.0  // works
const val TWO = ONE + ONE  // works
const val PI2 = PI  // doesn't work
```
