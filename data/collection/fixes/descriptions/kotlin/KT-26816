Example:
```
val configurations = listOf(
    3 to mapOf(
        2 to listOf(
            {
                2
            }
        )
    )
)
```
Report about type mismatch (`Required: Nothing, Found: List<() -> Int>`) is generated near `listOf` (`mapOf` and the like have the same behaviour).

With one/two levels it's OK:
```
val configurations = mapOf(
    2 to listOf(
        {
            2
        }
    )
)
```
```
val configurations = listOf(
        {
            2
        }
)
```
