The following code compiles on 1.2.70 and doesn't compile on 1.3.0-rc-57:
```
var result: String? = null
var i = 0
while (result == null) {
    if (i == 10) result = "non null"
    else i++
}
println(result.length)
```
The issue is that `result` is smart casted to non-nullable `String` on 1.2.70 and doesn't on 1.3.0-rc-57
