Consider this code:

```kotlin
open class Foo

class Bar : Foo()

fun findByName(name: String): Foo? = TODO()

private fun findOrCreateBar(name: String): Bar =
    findByName(name)?.let { existing ->
        if (existing !is Bar) error("!!!")
        existing as Bar
    } ?: Bar()
```

In the line 10, there is a warning on the `existing as Bar` cast: 'No cast needed'

However, removing this cast leads to an error where the whole `.let { ... }` expression is typed as `Foo`, not `Bar` as one would expect.
