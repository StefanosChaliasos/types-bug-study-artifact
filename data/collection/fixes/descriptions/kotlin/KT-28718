The following code:
```
@Suppress("SimplifyBooleanWithConstants")
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println(-0.0 < 0.0)
    println(-0.0 < 0)
}
```
Produces the following output:
```
false
true
```

When compiled with the following flags:
```
-progressive
-XXLanguage:+NewInference
```

At least for my tests it only produces this output when both flags are present. If only one (or none) of the flags are present it produces the following output:
```
false
false
```

The expression evaluation feature also results in `false` (in all my tested cases) for the second print statement, see the attached image.

The actual difference/error is also produced when `-0.0` is not a constant, which caused quite some headache on my part :(

I tested this with java 8 and 10 on windows 10 with the IDE version 2018.3.1, and with kotlin version 1.3.11
