The code is:
```
fun test(x: () -> Unit, y: () -> Unit) {
    x() // 1 is printed
    y() // 1 is printed
}

fun main() {
    test {
        println("1")
    } {
        println("2")
        Hello + world
    }
}
```
1) We aren't report about more than one lambdas outside a parenthesized is passed ("Error: Only one lambda expression is allowed outside a parenthesized argument list")
2) When the second lambda is called inside `test` then the first lambda is called actually.
3) In the second lambda we can write any unresolved variables and compiler won't report (isn't analyzed by compiler)
