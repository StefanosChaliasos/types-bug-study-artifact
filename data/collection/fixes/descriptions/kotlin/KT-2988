this code now fails for me in the kool.io project (you can clone it here https://github.com/koolio/kool)
{code}
package somthing

import java.util.ArrayList

public class Cheese<T>(val collection: List<T>) {
    private val listeners = ArrayList<T>()

    public fun doSomething(): Int {
        var count = 0
        for (listener in listeners) {
            count += 1
        }
        return count
    }
}
{code}
The 'listener' expression in the for loop is highlighted in IDEA too with the same error as you get with the maven build:
{code}
ERROR: /workspace/java/kool/kool-stream/src/main/kotlin/io/kool/collection/Cheese.kt: (10, 26) None of the hasNext() functions is applicable for iterator() of type 'jet.MutableIterator<T>?'
ERROR: /workspace/java/kool/kool-stream/src/main/kotlin/io/kool/collection/Cheese.kt: (10, 26) None of the next() functions is applicable for iterator() of type 'jet.MutableIterator<T>?'
{code}
to fix this code if you add an explicit type of MutableList<T> to the val...
{code}
    private val listeners: MutableList<T> = ArrayList<T>()
{code}
it then compiles again. What is very strange though is, I can't get this same code to fail to compile in the kotlin project itself - have tried everything I can think of to make it fail. So something really odd is going on for this bug! :) 

Any ideas? Fails on the project using 0.1-SNAPSHOT or 0.4.68. No idea why I can't get the code to fail inside the kotlin project though!
