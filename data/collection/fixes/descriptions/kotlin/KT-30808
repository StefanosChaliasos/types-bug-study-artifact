```
// J.java

public class J {
	public J(String... objects) {}
}

// main.kt

fun main() {
    val array: Array<String>? = null
    
    // [USELESS_ELVIS_RIGHT_IS_NULL] Right operand of elvis operator (?:) is useless if it is null
    // but no [SPREAD_OF_NULLABLE] The spread operator (*foo) may not be applied to an argument of nullable type
    J(*array ?: null)
}
```

Result of running `main`:

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
	at AKt.main(A.kt:6)
	at AKt.main(A.kt)
```

Reproduced with 1.3.30-eap-125, failed to reproduce with 1.3.40-dev-1364. Looks like it was (accidentally?) fixed in 1.3.40, a regression test should probably be added.

Note: simple case without USELESS_ELVIS_RIGHT_IS_NULL is already reported in 1.3.30 after https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/commit/7f48897e21663c6838fe51234f4d6a96ce5b660b.
