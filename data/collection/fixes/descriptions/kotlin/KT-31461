Original title: ""Add non-null asserted call" & "replace with safe call" quick fixes is not shown on multiline expression"

code:
``` val x: Int? = 42
    val y: Int? = 42
    val q = x +
            y
```
There are no "Add non-null asserted call" & "replace with safe call" quick fixes for initializer of `q` in Kotlin plugin 1.3.50-dev-225, but works fine for 1.3.31
