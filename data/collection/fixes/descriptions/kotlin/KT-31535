I just upgraded to Android Studio Kotlin plugin 1.3.40-eap-21-Studio3.5-1, and am seeing a new warning that I don't believe (see attached screenshot). The `Nothing` type in question isn't being inferred, we're declaring it very intentionally. 

To reproduce clone https://github.com/square/workflow and check out SHA `02a87fc6c4507f7c007f5de0d95fa125c796e32e`. Open in Android Studio 3.5b2 with Kotlin plugin Kotlin plugin 1.3.40-eap-21-Studio3.5-1, and look at class `WorkerCompositionIntegrationTest`. Every warning in there is an example of this.

The inspection was introduced as a fix for KT-20849, in https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/commit/70c35f4186b56554bcb1cd17a89124e5a460297c.
