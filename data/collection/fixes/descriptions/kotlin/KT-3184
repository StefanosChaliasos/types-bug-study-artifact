The "0" line works just fine, the "1" line seems to have no idea of what the type of "it" should be.
I'm fairly sure this worked before Kotlin plugin 0.4.323.

{code}
fun tests() {
    val dict = HashMap<String, (String) -> Unit>()
    dict["0"] = { str -> println(str) }
    dict["1"] = { println(it) }
}
{code}
