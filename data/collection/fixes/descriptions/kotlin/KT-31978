```
return try {
            applicationContext.packageManager?.getPackageInfo(uri, PackageManager.GET_ACTIVITIES) != null ?: false
        } catch (e: PackageManager.NameNotFoundException) {
            false
        }
```

IDE highlight in red with ```Operator '!=' cannot be applied to 'PackageInfo?' and 'Boolean' ```

Obviously the ```?: false``` is unneeded but it does compile and no red highlight with 1.3.31
