This code worked previously on 1.3.31:
```kotlin
    fun foo(x: Int): Either<String, Int> =
        if (x == 0) {
            x.right()
        } else {
            bar()
        }
    
    fun bar(): Either<String, Nothing> = "".left()
```

`Either` is from arrow-kt, reproduced here:
```kotlin
fun <A> A.left(): Either<A, Nothing> = Either.Left(this)

fun <A> A.right(): Either<Nothing, A> = Either.Right(this)
```

A picture of the error is attached. This error is only present in the IDE (i.e., the compiler does not complain).
