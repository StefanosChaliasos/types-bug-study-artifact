Kotlin version: 1.3.40
Android Kotlin plugin version: 1.3.40-release-Studio3.5-1
IDE: Android Studio 3.5 Beta 4

I have this wrapper class:
```kotlin
class Query<out T : Any> private constructor(
    private val result: T?,
    private val error: Throwable?,
    val inProgress: Boolean
) {
    companion object {
        val inProgress = Query(null, null, true)
        fun forError(e: Throwable) = Query(null, e, false)
        fun <T : Any> forResult(result: T) = Query(result, null, false)
    }
}
```
The code:
```kotlin
val liveData = MutableLiveData<Query<Int>>()
liveData.value = Query.inProgess
```
used to have no errors both with the IDE static analysis and with the compiler; after updating the Kotlin and Kotlin plugin version fom 1.3.31 to 1.3.40, the IDE shows an error in the `liveData.value` assignment:
> Type mismatch. Required: Query<Int>, found: Query<Any>

yet the code compiles with no errors about this.

On a side note, the current way to fix things back in the IDE is to explicitly declare the returned type of `Query.inProgress` as `Query<Nothing>` (which in fact understandably respects the type projection and hierarchy).
