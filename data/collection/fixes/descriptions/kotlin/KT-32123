Steps to reproduce:
1. Use Intellij Kotlin Plugin 1.3.40 (I used it in Android Studio, so it was 1.3.40-release-Studio3.5-1)
2. Check that "Enable new type inference algorithm for IDE analysis" is selected 
3. Add `implementation 'androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-livedata-ktx:2.2.0-alpha01'` to your dependencies
4. Add a following code:
```kotlin
import androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleOwner
import androidx.lifecycle.LiveData
import androidx.lifecycle.observe

fun foo(f: LiveData<String>, owner: LifecycleOwner) {
    f.observe(owner) { TODO() }
}
```
5.  `import androidx.lifecycle.observe` is unused, that is actually  in `f.observe(owner) { TODO() }`

I'm happy to share the whole example as well if that is not enough. (Also you can see it in https://github.com/romannurik/muzei in ChooseProviderFragment)
