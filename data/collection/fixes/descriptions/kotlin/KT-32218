Starting from Kotlin v1.3.40, the IDE no longer accepts calls to `get` on a `Map` whose key is declared as `out`, saying "Type inference failed. The value of the type parameter K should be mentioned in input types (argument types, receiver types or expected type). Try to specify it explicitly".
You can reproduce the bug with the following code:
```
val map: Map<out Any, Any> = mapOf(
	true to true,
	1L to 1L
)
val test = map[1L] //IDE error: "Type inference failed. The value of the type parameter K should be mentioned in input types (argument types, receiver types or expected type). Try to specify it explicitly
```
