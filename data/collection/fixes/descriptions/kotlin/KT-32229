I've updated to koltin 1.3.40 and got an error on some classes, I'm sure this is about the new inference algorithm, because when i disable it android studio says that everything is fine, I've attached a print of the error but here's the code anyway:

```kotlin
abstract class Base
class A : Base()
class B : Base()
class C : Base()

fun main() {
  val list = listOf(
    1 to { A() },
    2 to { B() },
    3 to { C() }
  )
}
```

If I annotate the list types it works correctly
Btw, I could not reproduce this on the playground :/ is the new algoritm enabled there?
