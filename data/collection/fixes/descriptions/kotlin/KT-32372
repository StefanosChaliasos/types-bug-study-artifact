Just cloned Exposed framework (https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) just for look and explore. 
Got following errors in IDEA:

File: Entity.kt

However, project compiles normally under Gradle and with Ctrl+F9, so I guess, the problem is not with the framework itself.

Using IDEA 2019.1, Kotlin 1.3.40. New type inference is not turned on.
