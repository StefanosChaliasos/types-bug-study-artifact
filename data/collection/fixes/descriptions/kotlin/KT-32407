For no apparent reason Intellj became very slow - freezing for 5-10 seconds every time I need to do auto-complete or do any work. Intellij became useless to me. It's constantly doing something in background, eating CPU, not responding to anything, then drawing persistent popups over all apps. I tried `Invalidate Cache & Restart`, doesn't help.
