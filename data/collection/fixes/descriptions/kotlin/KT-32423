Consider the following code: 
```

import java.time.DayOfWeek
import java.time.LocalDateTime

class Y {
    fun x() {
        val foo = if(LocalDateTime.now().dayOfWeek == DayOfWeek.WEDNESDAY) mutableListOf<String>() else null
        val bar = foo ?: listOf()
    }
}

```

This will lead to a compile problem:
```
Error:(9, 26) Kotlin: Type inference failed. Expected type mismatch: inferred type is List<???> but MutableList<String> was expected
```
However in the IDE not error marking is added to the code, giving the suggestion the code is correct.
