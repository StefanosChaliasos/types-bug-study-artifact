This is the property
`private val guilds = HashMap<Long, CompletableDeferred<GuildData>>()`

The compiler throws `UninferredParameterTypeConstructor` if we use this code (The IDE doesn't show any errors)
`guilds[id] = CompletableDeferred()`

We fixed it by replacing the above code with this (The IDE didn't say the type parameter was redundant either)
`guilds[id] = CompletableDeferred<GuildData>()`
