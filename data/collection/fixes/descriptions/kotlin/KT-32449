```
inline fun <reified T: Any?> AppCompatActivity.extra(key: String): Lazy<T> = lazy {
    val value = intent.extras?.get(key)

    require(value is T) {
        "Couldn't find extra with key \"$key\" from type " + T::class.java.canonicalName
    }

    value
}
```

This error is reported by compiler, but not IDE (new type inference)
```
AlbumDetailsActivity.kt: (44, 78): Type inference failed. Expected type mismatch: inferred type is Lazy<Any?> but Lazy<T> was expected
