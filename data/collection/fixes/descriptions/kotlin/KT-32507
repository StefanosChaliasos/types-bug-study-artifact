What steps will reproduce the issue?

1. Enter the following Kotlin source code in a file:
  ```
fun foo(bar: Any?): Int {
    bar as String?
    bar ?: throw IllegalStateException()
    return bar.length
}

fun main() {
    println(foo("Hello World"))
}
  ```
2. Compile / run it - this works, so the Kotlin compiler accepts this code
3. But the IntelliJ Kotlin plugin shows an error underline/marker on `return bar.length` (specifically on the dot) that says "Only safe (?.) or non-null aasserted (!!.) calls are allowed on a nullable receiver of type Any?". So not only did it miss the non-nullable assertion that throws an IllegalStateException; it also missed the cast to `String?`

What is the expected result?

The Kotlin plugin in IntelliJ should not show the incorrect error hover/marker
