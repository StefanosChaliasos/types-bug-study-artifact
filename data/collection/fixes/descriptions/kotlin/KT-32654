If I have the following code:

```
override val animationProgressChannel: ReceiveChannel<Float> = resumeScope.produce {
    lottieAnimation.addAnimatorUpdateListener { animation ->
      resumeScope.launch {
        channel.send(animation.animatedValue as Float)
      }
    }

    awaitClose()
  }
```

`channel`, and `awaitClose()` both get highlighted as a warning that says:

> Non-applicable call for builder inference

The warning goes away if I change it to `resumeScope.produce<Float> { ... }`, but then the `Remove explicit type arguments` inspection is triggered on the `produce<Flow>`.
