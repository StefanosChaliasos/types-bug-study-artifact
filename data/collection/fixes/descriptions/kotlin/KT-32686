With the `Enable new type inference algorithm for IDE analysis` option ticked, this will be accepted by the IDE, but wrong type is inferred:

```kotlin
sealed class Base<T> {
    class A<T> : Base<T>()
    class B<T> : Base<T>()
}

fun getBase(num: Int) = when (num) {
    1 -> Base.A()
    else -> Base.B<Int>()
}
```

As you can see on this screenshot, the inferred type of `getBase()` is `Base.B<Int>` because it has the <Int> type parameter specified explicitly.

The compiler's error message is the following:
`Error:(8, 25) Kotlin: Type inference for control flow expression failed. Please specify its type explicitly.`

When specifying `Base.A<Int>` explicitly, it works correctly with both the old and the new algorithm
