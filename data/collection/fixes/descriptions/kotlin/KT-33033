If you have code, such as below

```
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus.OK
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity

fun <T> ok(resource: T) = response(resource, OK)
fun <T> okOrNotFound(response: T?) = if (response != null) ok(response) else notFound()
fun <T> notFound() = response<T>(null, NOT_FOUND)
fun <T> response(resource: T?, status: HttpStatus) = ResponseEntity(resource, status)
```

The function `okOrNotFound()` shows an error, even though the code compiles without errors or warnings from Kotlin compiler via Gradle.  I would have expected these to match.
