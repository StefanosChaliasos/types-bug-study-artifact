Type inference is failing using direct call, instead of `invoke` on delegated property.
Reproduced shortly here:

```
val workingOne by Scope(5)
val workingTwo: Int? by Scope.invoke()
val notWorking: Int? by Scope() // Type inference failed: Not enough information to infer parameter T in inline operator fun <reified T> Scope.invoke(): TestProperty<T> Please specify it explicitly.
```
