```
fun main() {
    val str = "foo bar baz"

    val tokens: List<String> = str.split([" "]) // (1)
    println(tokens)
}
```

There is no error in the new type inference on the line (1).
In the old type inference, there are two errors: 
1) Kotlin: None of the following functions can be called with the arguments supplied: (...)
2) Kotlin: Unsupported [Collection literals outside of annotations]

It is only IDE bug, in both cases, we get compile errors.
