I'm trying to test dev builds of 1.3.60 since it contains a multitude of kapt-related fixes prior to the first EAP to ensure that they work. When I point my project at any 1.3.60 dev build, Gradle starts a Kotlin daemon, appears to connect, and then hangs indefinitely.

The project is at https://github.com/JakeWharton/SdkSearch/. I have a branch [pointed at the latest dev build](https://github.com/JakeWharton/SdkSearch/compare/jakew/sixty/2019-09-27) (at the time of writing) named `jakew/sixty/2019-09-27`.

I have stopped all Gradle and Kotlin daemons before trying a build. I've tried JDK 8 and JDK 11 which both produce the same result. Attached are logs from Gradle's side. I'm not sure how to get logs from the Kotlin daemon, if there are any.
