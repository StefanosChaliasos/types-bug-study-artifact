Repro: a parse tree for the following code:
```
        val code = """
            |fun f(x: Int) {
            |    when (x) {
            |        !in 10..20 -> print(5)
            |    }
            |}
        """.trimMargin()
```

contains a `KtWhenConditionInRange` whose `isNegated()` returns false.

Digging into the tree a bit, it seems that the following would work:
```
val isNegated = firstChild?.node?.findChildByType(KtTokens.NOT_IN) != null
```
