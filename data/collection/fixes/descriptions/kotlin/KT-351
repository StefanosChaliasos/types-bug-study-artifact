Prohibit use control structures 'for', 'while' in expression positions, like:
{code}
val w = while (true) {}
{code}

Infer right type while coercion to Unit (assignments, 'for' and 'while' structures sometimes should have 'Unit' type and sometimes 'null'):
{code}
fun foo() {
    var z = 2
    val r = {  // type fun(): Int is inferred
        if (true) {
            2
        }
        else {
            z = 34
        }
    }
}
{code}

old:
While coercion to unit (of declarations and assignments) it might be unclear if error was happened or not (null is returned in both cases).
'Statement type' type will distinguish these cases.
