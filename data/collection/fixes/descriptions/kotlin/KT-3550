{code}
private class JsonArray {}
fun jsonArray(body: JsonArray.()->Unit): ActionResult {}
{code}
This code should issue "Inconsistent accessibility error", because public function uses private class in its parameter (or return) types. 
Currently it shows error on call site (Kotlin: Cannot access 'value': it is 'internal' in 'JsonArray') (why internal? it's private), but if I have different 'value' function accessible, errors become cryptic.
