Get `build.gradle.kts`-based project with Gradle wrapper 6.0+ (attached one is enough). Import the project into IJ and open `settings.gradle.kts`. Note that highlighting is broken. Try to reimport gradle project and nothing happens. That's the issue.

NB: highlighting is still broken even after project reopening.
