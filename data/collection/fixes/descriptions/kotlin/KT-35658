The new inference filters flexible types (in type argument position), so CST calculation is inconsistent with OI (but also correct).

NI: `CST(Inv<T?>, Inv<T!>, Inv<T>)`, `CST(Inv<T?>, Inv<T>, Inv<T!>)` -> `Inv<out T?>`
OI: `CST(Inv<T!>, Inv<T,> Inv<T?>)`, ... -> `Inv<T!>`

So it was possible to write the code, that would be "red" after turning on the new inference.
