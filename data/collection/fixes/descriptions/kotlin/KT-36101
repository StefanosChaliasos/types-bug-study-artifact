I intentionally set some suspending functions return type to `Nothing` (e.g. when they have an infinite loop that only cancellation or a Throwble will stop).

Then, the `IMPLICIT_NOTHING_AS_TYPE_PARAMETER` inspections comes to annoy me.
If I specify the type to tell it to shut up, another one tells me it's unnecessary and suggests to remove it.

This first inspection is unnecessary to me since if I try to run code after the call inferred to `Nothing`, I'll be warned anyway for unreachable code (and that's what I want and the whole point of marking my functions as never returning with the `Nothing` type).

So, please, delete the `IMPLICIT_NOTHING_AS_TYPE_PARAMETER` inspection, and prevent it from coming again in Kotlin (BTW, I don't have the option to disable it in the inspections menu of the IDE).

You can see the attached screenshot how irrelevant it is. For some reason, it's even shown twice.
