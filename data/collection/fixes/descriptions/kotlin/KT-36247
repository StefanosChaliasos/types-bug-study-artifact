Descriptors are heavy and it's a good practice to avoid creating them. There is a problem in NI that for some reason we create stub descriptor during resolve, which I believe isn't needed for most cases (but this should be investigated). The problematic place is in [`KotlinCallCompleter.prepareCandidateForCompletion`](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/master/compiler/resolution/src/org/jetbrains/kotlin/resolve/calls/components/KotlinCallCompleter.kt#L167) method, see `bindStubResolvedCallForCandidate` call
I propose getting rid of this call, it should improve performance and memory consumption
