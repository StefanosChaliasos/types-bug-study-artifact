Code:
```
fun func(map: Map<String, () -> Unit>) {}

fun foo() : Unit {}

fun test() {
    func(mapOf("foo" to ::foo)) //Works
    func(mapOf("abc" to {})) //Works

    //IDE error, but compiles fine:
    func(mapOf(
        "foo" to ::foo,
        "bar" to { }
    ))

    //No error, compiles fine
    func(mapOf<String, () -> Unit>(
        "foo" to ::foo,
        "bar" to { }
    ))
}
```

The reported error is:
```
Required: Pair<String, KFunction0<Unit>>
Found: Pair<String, () â†’ Unit>
```

The issue started appearing after upgrading the Koltin plugin, which is now at version `1.3.70-release-IJ2019.3-1`. With the previous version, it worked.
New type inference algorithm is enabled for IDE analysis.
