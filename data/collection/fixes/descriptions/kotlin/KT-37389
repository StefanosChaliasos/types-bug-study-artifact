See [`generateNewConstraint`](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/master/compiler/resolution/src/org/jetbrains/kotlin/resolve/calls/inference/components/ConstraintIncorporator.kt#L114) method in `ConstraintIncorporator`. Currently, we approximate types before adding them into a constraint system to remove intermediate captured types but this is not needed for equality constraints as for them intermediate captured types are not created (and now we'll run approximation twice for equality constraints).

The proposal is to avoid approximation for equality constraints.
