Currently, for each call (generic or not) we'll run type approximation and then type substitution, see [`substitutedResultingDescriptor `](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/master/compiler/frontend/src/org/jetbrains/kotlin/resolve/calls/tower/KotlinToResolvedCallTransformer.kt#L767) method. 
This is not needed for simple calls that don't have own type parameters and don't return some internal type (captured and so on). 

Plus, I'm not sure that we should run approximation for parameters, the opportunity of not running approximation for parameters should be also investigated.
