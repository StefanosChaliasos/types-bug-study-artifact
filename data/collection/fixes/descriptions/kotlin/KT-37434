Setup Kotlin/JS project.
Make sure the output format is JS IR. Tested `kotlin.js.compiler=ir` in `gradle.properties`.
Make sure the language version == 1.4, so fun interfaces are supported.

Provide dummy:
```
fun interface FunFace {
    fun dummy()
}

fun acceptFun(funFace: FunFace) {}

class ResolutionTest {
    @Test fun testIt() {
        acceptFun(FunFace {})
    }
}
```

Get compiler (and IDE) error RESOLUTION_TO_CLASSIFIER: "Interface FunFace does not have constructors".

This error is shown with language version == 1.3 for JVM backend too.
But with language version == 1.4 the code is compiled fine into JVM backend. Probably also should into JavaScript?

Kotlin 1.4-M1-eap-89.
