The following code illustrates the problem:

```
fun main() {
    val x = arrayOf(Int.MAX_VALUE, Long.MAX_VALUE)
    for(a in x) {
        println(a.toDouble())
    }
}
```

This code looks fine in the IDE, but when trying to compile it the following error is displayed:

```
e: /path/to/file.kt: (38, 19): Unresolved reference. None of the following candidates is applicable because of receiver type mismatch: 
public inline fun String.toDouble(): Double defined in kotlin.text
```
