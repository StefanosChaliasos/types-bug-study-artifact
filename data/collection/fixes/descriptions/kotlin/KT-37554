The elvis operator `?:` in code below gets an error in Idea, saying "Type mismatch. Required: Nothing Found: ClosedRange\<LocalDate\>". Despite that, the code builds and runs fine, both from Idea and via Gradle. It is still super annoying, because the files are marked as containing errors.
Happens in 1.3.70 and not with earlier versions.

```
import java.time.LocalDate

data class DailyTime(val date: LocalDate)

fun <T : Comparable<T>> Sequence<T>.range(): ClosedRange<T>? {
    val iter = iterator()
    return when {
        iter.hasNext() -> iter.next().let { it..it }
        else -> null
    }
}

fun test(dailyTimes: List<DailyTime>): List<DailyTime> {
    val dateRange = dailyTimes.asSequence().map { it.date }.range() ?: return emptyList()
    println(dateRange.start)
    return dailyTimes
}
```
