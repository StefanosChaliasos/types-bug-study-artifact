The following code doesn't work as intended:

    val y: Any = mapOf("foo" to "bar")
    y as Map<*, *>
    y as Map<String, Any?>
    y.forEach { (k: String, u: Any?) -> //error on k: Type mismatch, required String, found Any?
    }
PS: the above code will  work by removing the second line


The issue seems to happen only when using a double cast, which can be useful in a lot of situations, for example:

    val y: Any = mapOf("foo" to "bar")
    if (y is Map<*, *>) {
        y as Map<String, Any?>
        y.forEach { (t: String, u: Any?) -> //error on k: Type mismatch, required String, found Any?
        }
    }
