The problem has appeared after https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/commit/ec4d9d2f1fd5463030190db15ddcf8acfaaadffd

The code is:
```
interface I

interface Foo<T> : I

class Bar<T>(val x: Foo<T>) : Foo<T>

fun <T, U : T> castToSubtype(obj: T) = obj as U

fun <T> select(vararg x: T) = x[0]

fun <T> materialize(): T = null as T

fun main() {
    select(
        materialize<Foo<Any>>(),
        Bar(
            castToSubtype(materialize<I>()) // NI: "required – Foo<Any>, found – I" afther the commit, OI – OK
        )
    )
}
```
