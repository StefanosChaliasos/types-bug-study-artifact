Why this is suddenly problem?, it was working with some older versions and it seems it stil compiles when I run maven install.
Do I have to mark the lambda literal somehow explicitly that it has a receiver?
The other image shows that when I use an intermediate variable with explicit type, then it still works

```
private fun getOperation(direction: Boolean): Int.() -> Int =
    if (direction) { -> this + 1 }
    else { -> this - 1 }
```

```
Type mismatch: inferred type is () -> [ERROR : Cannot infer type variable TypeVariable(_L)] but Int.() -> Int was expected
'this' is not defined in this context
```
