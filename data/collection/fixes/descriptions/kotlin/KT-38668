I am facing an error while building my project with new kotlin version 1.3.71 and the associated libs. The same project works if I change the versions to 1.3.61 or remove module dependency

`e: Cannot access class 'kotlinx.coroutines.CoroutineExceptionHandler'. Check your module classpath for missing or conflicting dependencies`

I have created a small reproducible project with two branches. master that does not build and gives an error and working-old-version that builds successful.
The only difference between the two branches is the versions of libs.

To  run the build
`SDK_NAME=iphoneos-hello ./gradlew :analytics:build`
