Short example:

```kotlin
abstract class B {
	inner class Inner
}

class C : B()

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
	val c = C()
	B().Inner() // ERROR: Cannot create an instance of an abstract class. And I don't want to create new instance!
	c.Inner() // ERROR: Unresolved reference: Inner
	(c : B).Inner() // Works, but it's complicated as for me
}
```
