New type inference does not perform SAM conversion for java classes with type parameters which are instantiated in java, in contrast to the old type inference. For example:
```java
public class A<T> {
  public void add(T x) {}
  public static class B extends A<Runnable> {}
}
```
```kotlin
fun test(x: A.B) {
  x.add { }
}
```
Fails with
```
test.kt:2:9: error: type mismatch: inferred type is () -> Unit but Runnable! was expected
  x.add { }
        ^
```
with new inference, but compiles without errors with old inference.
