The compilation of the following code:

```kotlin
interface Base
class Foo : Base

fun <T : Base> run(action: () -> T): T = action()

fun main() {
    Foo().also { f: Foo ->
        run { f }
    }
}
```

Fails with the following error:

```
repro.kt:8:13: error: type mismatch: inferred type is Unit but Base was expected
        run { f }
            ^
```

Any of the following changes in the code can fix the issue:
 - Replacing `<T: Base>` with just `T` in the `run` function.
 - Explicit returning `Unit` from the `also` lambda, like `run { f }; Unit`.
 - Replacing `also` with `let`. Probably any function that accepts `(T) -> Any` or `(T) -> R` instead of `(T) -> Unit` will work.
