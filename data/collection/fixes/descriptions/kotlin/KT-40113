Create a Gradle Kotlin DSL project with `application` Gradle plugin applied. Result:

```
distributions { // COMPATIBILITY_WARNING
     main { // FUNCTION_EXPECTED
     }
}
```
```
[FUNCTION_EXPECTED] Expression 'main' cannot be invoked as a function. The function 'invoke()' is not found
[UNRESOLVED_REFERENCE_WRONG_RECEIVER] Unresolved reference.
None of the following candidates is applicable because of receiver type mismatch:

public val DistributionContainer.main: NamedDomainObjectProvider<Distribution> defined in org.gradle.kotlin.dsl
public val SourceSetContainer.main: NamedDomainObjectProvider<SourceSet> defined in org.gradle.kotlin.dsl
```
```
[COMPATIBILITY_WARNING] Candidate resolution will be changed, please invoke explicitly:

public fun Project.distributions(configure: Action<DistributionContainer>): Unit defined in org.gradle.kotlin.dsl
```

Looks like the error doesn't affect Gradle import, it's only red code in the IDE.

Kotlin 1.4-M3, 1.4.20-dev-1831.
