We have separate CI builds that build our repo against newer versions of Kotlin to try them out and catch issues early. In updating from 1.4-M2 to 1.4-M3, we noticed that the new `UnitConversion` feature will always run, even on existing lambda parameters that were valid in 1.3. This results in an esoteric compiler error during gradle like so

```
e: /home/ubuntu/actions-runner/_work/repo/app/src/main/java/com/Slack/mgr/channelsync/ChannelSyncManagerImpl.kt: (88, 7): The feature "unit conversion" is disabled

FAILURE: Build completed with 2 failures.

1: Task failed with an exception.
-----------
* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':app:compileExternalReleaseKotlin'.
> A failure occurred while executing org.jetbrains.kotlin.compilerRunner.GradleKotlinCompilerWork
   > Compilation error. See log for more details
```

The implementation for this is fairly simple. Incomplete, but the gist is that it's a lambda/function parameter

```kotlin
private class OnJobDone(
    private val jobDone: (Job) -> Unit,
    val allDone: () -> Unit
)
private val callbacks = OnJobDone(
    jobDone = jobToChannelId andThen trackChannelSynced,
    // Fails on the next line
    allDone = {
      // ...
    }
)
```

In going down the rabbit hole on this, I found this feature was added in [this PR](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/commit/71cbe9768869db76b6ee54f44faca7d75de7be6f#diff-7452279877696ef5b9e37340da047d77) but I wasn't able to find much details on it.

This reveals a couple of interesting things

1 - The new type inference system is no longer enabled by default in 1.4-M3. I couldn't find anything about this in release notes, but was surprised to see this
2 - The new UnitConverstion feature appears to be running (erroneously?) on existing compatible lambda parameters without any changes to source. It also depends on the new type inference system, which also wasn't manually enabled.

To work around this, I have to manually enabled both the new type inference system _and_ UnitConversion in order to make our build pass with 1.4-M3, despite no source changes.

```kotlin
freeCompilerArgs += listOf("-XXLanguage:+UnitConversion", "-XXLanguage:+NewInference")
```

I think the change in type inference behavior warrants some clarification, and I think UnitConversion is accidentally running when it shouldn't (i.e. should be gated on the feature)
