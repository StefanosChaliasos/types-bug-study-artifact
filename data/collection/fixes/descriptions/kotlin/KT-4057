{code}
Kotlin: 'K' has a nullable upper bound. This means that a value of this type may be null. Using 'K?' is likely to mislead the reader
{code}
I see for example
{code}
inline fun <K, T:Iterable<K>> T.firstOrEmpty() : K? {
  for(k in this) return k
  return null
}
{code}

The idea here is that I want the code work either for {{List<String>}} and for {{List<String?>}}. It looks I had to use K? in the declaration.

BTW. Is it assumed K? == K??   ?
