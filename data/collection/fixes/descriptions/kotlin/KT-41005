Consider the following code:
```kotlin
fun <T> f(m: () -> T?) = m()
fun main() {
    println(f<Unit> { null })
}
```

It prints `Unit` while in 1.3.72 it prints `null`. The root problem is that lambda expression `{ null }` gets type `() -> Unit` because of coercion to `Unit`, but actually it should be `() -> Unit?`
