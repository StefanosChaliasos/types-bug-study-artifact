Type inference in suspend blocks with `?:` operator expressions seems to be broken. This particular issues seems specific to suspend blocks and works correctly in 1.3.x. In Kotlin 1.4.0 the type inferred for `outputList` in the below example is `Any?` rather than `List<String>`. To illustrate this better I'll provide some playground links.

Code snippet working as expected in 1.3 playground:

Same code snippet no longer compiles when switching to 1.4.0:

Two different ways to get this compile in 1.4.0.
First, specify type explicitly:

And also by specifying the type on the `listOf()` function:

(Interesting thing about this last one is IntelliJ shows the `<String>` part in the `listOf()` function as unnecessary and suggests to remove it. Removing it causes the code to no longer compile.)
