Actually, the "package" created for class should be invisible as well. References to "package" should be marked as invisible, not unresolved.

{code:title=java}package javaPackage;

public class Foo {
    private static class Bar {
        public static void doSmth() {
        }
    }
}{code}

{code:title=kotlin}
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    javaPackage.Foo.Bar.doSmth() // should be invisible
}{code}
