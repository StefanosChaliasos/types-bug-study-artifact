The compiler works infinitely both in IDE (Build -> Build Project) and within `:extended-persistence:compileKotlin` Gradle task. (extended-persistence module is also known to freeze IDEA because of lots of generics if new inference is enabled)
[Broken build](https://travis-ci.org/github/Miha-x64/Lychee/builds/723712304); [the commit which leads to infinite compilation](https://github.com/Miha-x64/Lychee/commit/b71b6b09060e07f53e101a28e413e494be8b7c7c) just changes plugin and stdlib versions, updates readme, and fixes compilation errors.
Affected versions: 1.4-M2, 1.4-M3, 1.4.0-rc, 1.4.0, 1.4.10-rc-408
1.4-M1 behaves differently and raises many compilation errors, so I don't know exactly whether compilation is finite.
1.3.70 works well.
