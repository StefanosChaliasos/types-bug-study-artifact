### Context

I'm using HMPP for all iOS, watchOS and macOS targets (which I know is not fully supported yet), and for the `NSInteger` problem that is either `Int` or `Long`, I just `expect`/`actual` the code relying on it for each affected target (not using HMPP for that). This issue is not related to `NSInteger` though.
