As you can see, the type of the `bundle` parameter is `NSBundle?` which is definitely nullable, yet we get an error passing `null` to it that says "Null can not be a value of a non-null type NSBundle?".

I think it's a regression or a weird edge case because I definitely saw it work properly in Kotlin 1.3.61.

### Reproducing steps

Create a new project in Android Studio 4.2 Canary 10 with the Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile app template. In the iosApp module, create a new file and add this code:

```kotlin
import platform.UIKit.UIViewController

class SomeVC : UIViewController(nibName = null, bundle = null) { // <-- Null can not be a value of a non-null type NSBundle?

}
```
