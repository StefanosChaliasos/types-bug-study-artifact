I have a Multiplatform project that acts as a business layer for our mobile app. Since migrating to kotlin 1.4.10, our build is stuck at the kotlinCompileIos job. It simply never finishes (waited for 3 hours). 

When running only this task in debug mode, I found that the last step that does anything is  "Run tool: "konanc" with args: -g -ea -target ios_x64 -p library -o"... after that, I only get endless lines of the following:
2020-09-26T15:24:04.214+0200 [LIFECYCLE] [org.gradle.cache.internal.DefaultFileLockManager]

If I remove all my code from the project and try to compile an empty project with the same dependency structure, it finishes properly.

Could you help me to understand what could be the cause of this? How may I help you to pinpoint the error?
