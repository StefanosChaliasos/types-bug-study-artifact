Steps to reproduce: see comments

Description: at some moment type `FirClass<CapturedType(*)>?` is passed to `DescriptorRendererImpl.renderType` with type normalizer which used `IdeDescriptorRenderers.unwrapAnonymousType` function. When renderer tries to render `CapturedType` that function replace captured type with its supertype, which is `FirClass<CapturedType(*)>`, so we get infinite recursion here
