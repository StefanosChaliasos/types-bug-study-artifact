When I try to compile Rider, I got a bizarre error.

```
Kotlin: Supertypes of the following classes cannot be resolved. Please make sure you have the required dependencies in the classpath:
    class com.jetbrains.rider.debugger.DotNetDebugProcess, unresolved supertypes: com.intellij.xdebugger.impl.ui.XDebugSessionTabCustomizer
```
I spent a lot of time to try to understand what wrong.
Some additional info:
we have a module: "rider" which contains class "DotNetDebugProcess" and module: "intellij.platform.debugger.impl" which contains interface "XDebugSessionTabCustomizer"
After a time I understood what error actually happened in module: "rider-android" which just referenced module "rider".
I didn't find any way how to understand it from compiler error.
To fix it an issue I need to add module dependency "intellij.platform.debugger.impl" into "rider-android". I still not understand why I have to do it?
Compiler error didn't help in this case.
