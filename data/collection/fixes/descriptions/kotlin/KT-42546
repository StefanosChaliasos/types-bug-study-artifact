Extracted from KT-41218, reproduced on ktor

Repro:
- depend on `kotlinx.coroutines`
- enable HMPP
- write the following code in JVM source set

```
fun CoroutineScope.test() {
    cancel() // OVERLOAD_RESOLUTION_AMBIGUITY
}
```
--- 

Another case which looks differently, but caused by the same issue (extracted from KT-41928): 
```
import platform.UIKit.UIViewController
class SomeVC : UIViewController(nibName = null, bundle = null) { // <-- Null can not be a value of a non-null type NSBundle?
}
```
