In the IDEA project the `CIDR-appcode/swift/language/src/com/jetbrains/swift/symbols/impl/SwiftInlineUtils.kt` (i've checked in the 202 branch) is red highlighted:

And compilation fails with:
```
/Users/nicolay.mitropolsky/IdeaProjects/IDEA-wt/CIDR-appcode/swift/language/src/com/jetbrains/swift/symbols/impl/SwiftInlineUtils.kt:22:37
Kotlin: Unresolved reference: declaringClass
```

If I try to resolve the type of `values.first()` IDEA navigates me to the `kotlin.Enum`

There is no such problem with `Kotlin 202.334-kid` plugin. and clicking on the `declaringClass` navigated me to the `java.lang.Enum`
