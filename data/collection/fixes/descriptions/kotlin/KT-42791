We have a reproducible test case -> https://github.com/asadmanji-springer/kotlin14-test-case (see the README.md for details)

Intellij, and indeed gradle as well if running from the command line, hangs consuming memory when trying to compile the class in the above test case. This was reproduced in various developer environments:
Build #IU-202.7319.50, built on September 14, 2020 + Kotlin plugin 1.4.0-release-IJ2020.2-1
Build #IU-203.4818.26, built on October 14, 2020 + Kotlin plugin 203-1.4.10-release-IJ4818.2
Build #IC-193.7288.26, built on May 6, 2020 + Kotlin plugin 1.4.10-release-IJ2019.3-1
and reproducible with JDK8,11,13,14

The build completes successfully and quickly if the target version is changed to kotlin 1.3
