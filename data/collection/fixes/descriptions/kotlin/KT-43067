The code below currently compiles without errors (but should not):
```
inline class Z(val x: Int) {
    inner class Inner(val y: Int) {
        val xx = x
    }
}
```

If we actually allow inner classes inside inline classes, please, make sure to add back-end tests (including at least box tests and ABI tests) for this feature.
