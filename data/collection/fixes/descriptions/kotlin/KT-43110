4.kt:2:7: warning: arguments execution order is going to be changed in a future release. The expression for named vararg argument will be executed in the order in which it was listed, not at the end. See KT-17691 for more details.
    f(args = arrayOf(""), x = true)
      ^
```

Two problems here:
1) The warning is either a false positive here, or it doesn't correctly tell what's going to change, since the arguments are listed in the same order as the corresponding parameters.
2) It refers to KT-17691, but there's no explanation in that issue. In fact, its description is outdated, and most comments are internal. We should update the description ASAP to avoid confusing users.
