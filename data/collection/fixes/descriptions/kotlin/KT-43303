Consider the example:
```kotlin
open class Foo
class Bar

fun <T : Foo> foo(): T? {
    return null
}

fun main() {
    val a: Bar? = foo()
}
```
This code can successfully be compiled (haven't checked JVM IR or JS IR backends though). This seems wrong, because the compiler shouldn't be able to infer correct types here, and with new inference disabled it does seem to report such an error.
