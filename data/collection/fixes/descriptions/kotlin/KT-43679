Hi there, 

using: 
* gradle 6.7
* Android Studio (AS) 4.1
 * kotlin 1.4.20
 * the kotlin plugin for AS 1.4.20

A specific kotlin file, using the [workflow library](https://square.github.io/workflow/) freezes the ide. 

Using yourkit, we found the following problem in the attached snapshot: 
 At 36mn, 12 sec, 2 threads are taking a lot of CPU

Thread1: ![](image1.png)

Thread 2: ![](image2.png)

Later you will see the CPU activity doing little spikes on :

Note the IDE doesn't recover, CPU activity is at 200%, and the IDE never gives its prompt back.
