Kotlin plugin incorrectly will not auto cast a val - saying that it could change.

(Latest plugin latest 13 EAP)

" is Double -> value" is highlighted as error saying the value could have changed and requires "  is Double -> value as Double" - even though it is a val and therefore cannot change.

public data class SensorValue<T>(public val value: T) {

    fun toString(): String? {
        return if(value == null) null else value.toString();
    }
    
    fun toDouble():Double? {
            return when (value) {
                null -> null 
                is Double -> value
                else -> value.toString().toDouble()
            }      
    }
}
