{code}
public trait A{
  public val x: Any
}

public class B(override public val x: Any) : A{
  fun foo(){
    if (x is String){
      val l = x.length
    }
  }
}
{code}

It underlines usage of 'x' and says it could have been changed and so not auto-casted. Removing 'public' modifier from the class declaration fixes it. I do not understand the reason.
