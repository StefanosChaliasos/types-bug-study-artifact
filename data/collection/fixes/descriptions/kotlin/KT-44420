This snippet reveals this warning:

```kotlin
fun test() {
  val collection: Collection<Int> = listOf(1, 2, 3)
  val list = ArrayList(collection)
}
```

```
w: ... Type mismatch: inferred type is List<Int> but MutableCollection<out Int!> was expected
```

Considering this only reads the contents of the collection internally and copies its elements, this seems wrong. This is also exactly what the `toMutableList()` extension does under the hood. I see the same issue with `HashSet` and similar common Java collections.
