  fun foo(map: MutableMap<String, String>, p: String?) {
    map["a"] = p

It highlights the expression at the left side of the assignment with some long text which is hard to understand. I would expect highlighting the right side with more clear explanation (like "Expression of type "String" is expected and "String?" found).
