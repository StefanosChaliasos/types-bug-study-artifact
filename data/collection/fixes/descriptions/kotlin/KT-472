If there are several files opened, variable declarations at namespace level are checked only in a one (the first in the lexicographical order). In others the contents is marked as 'not resolved to anything'.

{code}
namespace my

val f : fun(Any) : Unit = { () : Unit => }

fun foo() {
    val g : fun(Any) : Unit = { () : Unit => }
}
{code}
