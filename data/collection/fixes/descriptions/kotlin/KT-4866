When there is a construct like "foo[...]" in code and reference to 'foo' is not resolved everything inside brackets is not resolved to anything. This causes different usability issues, in particular, entities used there are not counted as usages and may be considered as unused.
BTW there is no such effect for construct like "foo(...)".
