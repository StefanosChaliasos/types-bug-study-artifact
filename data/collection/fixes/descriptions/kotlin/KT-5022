The logic prohibiting named arguments for Java methods is already there ([1c5df773|https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/commit/1c5df773c537b9d5d2d4b71ed87a4399be700ac2]), but it seems that it doesn't work.

To reproduce, see Kotlin `master@{2014-05-13}`, `KotlinResolveCache.java`, lines 242-248:
{code}
                    TopDownAnalysisParameters.createForLazy(
                            resolveSession.getStorageManager(),
                            resolveSession.getExceptionTracker(),
                            analyzeCompletely = { true },
                            analyzingBootstrapLibrary = false,
                            declaredLocally = false
                    ),
{code}

`createForLazy` is a Java method.
