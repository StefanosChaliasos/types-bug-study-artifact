```kotlin
interface A {
    fun foo()
}

class B {
    companion object : A { // Error
    }
}
```

Diagnostic message is:
Error:(8, 15) Kotlin: Object 'Companion' must be declared abstract or implement abstract member public abstract fun foo(): Unit defined in A

This message is misleading, since `object` can't be abstract.
This is also true for regular objects, e.g.:

```kotlin
interface IFoo {
    fun foo()
}

object X : IFoo
// Error:(7, 1) Kotlin: Object 'X' must be declared abstract or implement abstract member 
//   public abstract fun foo(): Unit defined in ktws.ws.fe_decls.IFoo
```
