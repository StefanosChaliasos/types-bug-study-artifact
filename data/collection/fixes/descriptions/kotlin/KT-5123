In the following code 'rotate' is highlighted as unresolved:
{code}
import java.util.Collections
val ref = Collections::rotate 
{code}

However it works properly if explicit import for method is added:
{code}
import java.util.Collections
import java.util.Collections.*
val ref = Collections::rotate 
{code}
