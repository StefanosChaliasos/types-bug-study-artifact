{code}
interface Foo
fun foo(): Foo? = null

public val foo: Foo = run {
    val x = foo()
    if (x == null) throw Exception() // return@run foo()!! has the same effect here
    x
}
{code}

It says it cannot infer correct type because x is nullable. But if I add "!!" after it, it's highlighted as redundant.
