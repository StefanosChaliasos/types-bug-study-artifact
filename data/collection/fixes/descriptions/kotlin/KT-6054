The problem is that property initialization is performed within constructor that called before static fields A/B initialized.

{code}
enum class MyEnum {
    A B
    val x = when(this) {
        A -> 1
        B -> 2
        else -> 3
    }
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println(MyEnum.A.x) //prints 3
    println(MyEnum.B.x) //prints 3
}
{code}
