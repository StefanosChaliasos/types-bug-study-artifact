Consider we have file
`package testpack

object MyObject {
    class MyClass
}`
which compiles successfully.
But main.kt
`import testpack.MyObject.MyClass

fun main(vararg args: String){
    val a: MyClass
}`
Generates error 
`Error:(6, 17) Kotlin: Cannot import from 'MyObject'`
Is it a bug or a feature so that we can't use types from objects?
