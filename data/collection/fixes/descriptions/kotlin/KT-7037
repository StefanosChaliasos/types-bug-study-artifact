Different resolution results in cases: 
1. By class name.
2. Without class name within member scope.

{code}
class A {
    companion object {
        val B = 1
    }
    object B {
        val prop = 1
    }
    
    fun foo() {
        val x1: Int = B // OK, B resolved to member of companion object
        val x2: Int = B.prop // Error, unresolved reference
    }
    val x1: Int = A.B // Error, type mismatch
    val x2: Int = A.B.prop // OK
}
