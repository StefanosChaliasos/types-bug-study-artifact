fun withLambda(block : Int.(String) -> Unit) {
}

fun withLambda(o : Int, block : Int.(String) -> Unit) {
}

fun a() {
    withLambda {
        it.length()
    }

    withLambda { r ->    // error here but it should be applicable
        r.length()
    }
}
{code}

I'am getting NONE_APPLICABLE here because of two similar functions with different parameters set so I can't rename "it" to something else. The only workaround is to change function names to make them different or force caller to use "it" instead of explicit name
