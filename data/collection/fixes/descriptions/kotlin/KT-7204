In two following examples

{code lang=kotlin}
fun calc(x: List<String>?): Int {
    x?.get(x!!.size() - 1) 
    // x?. or x!! above should not provide smart cast here
    return x.size()
}
{code}

and

{code lang=kotlin}
fun calc(x: List<String>?, y: Int?): Int {
    x?.get(y!! - 1) 
    // x?. or y!! above should not provide smart cast here
    return x.size() + y
}
{code}

compiler performs a smart cast for both return statements. However, it is a false smart cast because x?. call covers only one branch. At runtime, NPE occurs for these statements.
