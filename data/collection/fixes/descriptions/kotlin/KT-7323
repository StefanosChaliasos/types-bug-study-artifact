I have cases where I want to construct classes only via functions, so the constructor is internal, but the function is public (this happens a lot in my builder classes where I don't want people to be confused by finding classes they try to construct when they should start with a builder function).  

So I hide the constructors, and use them in the function within the same kotlin file. But it won't let me :-(

Of course I want to expose the class to be used, but not to be constructed without some help.  And a companion object isn't desired in this case but is the fallback if this is never allowed...
