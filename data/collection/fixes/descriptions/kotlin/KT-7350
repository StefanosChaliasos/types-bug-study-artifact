Here's a Gist: https://gist.github.com/Ribesg/31d1374a63a1acb7f762#file-configurationsection-kt-L76

On line 76 there's a warning on `?.` just before the `let` call. It says it's an unnecessary safe call, while the method can clearly return null on line 18. Adding a `?` after the return type of that last method throw another warning saying that `T?` is weird, which I understand as `T` could be for example `Int?`. One of those 2 warnings shouldn't be thrown imho.

I have no idea if this is related to https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-6763
