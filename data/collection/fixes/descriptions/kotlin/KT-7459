``` kotlin
trait A {
    fun foo(x : Any)
}

trait B : A {
    fun foo(x : String)
}

fun bar(x : A, y : A){
    var z : A = x;
    if(z !is B) return;
    z = y;
    z.foo(""); // Error: Smart cast to 'B' is impossible, because 'z' could have changed since the is-check
}
```

I'm not sure this error is appropriate here, because I reassigned a different object to `z` and trying to invoke a method `foo` declared in the trait `A`.
