Currently there's no way of declaring an enum with a static method visible from the Java side, e.g.:

```
enum class Pattern {
    THIS
    THAT
    
    companion object {
        public platformStatic fun determine(s: String): Pattern = THIS
    }
}
```

leads to an error message

```
Error: Kotlin: Only functions in named objects and companion objects of classes can be annotated with 'platformStatic'
```
