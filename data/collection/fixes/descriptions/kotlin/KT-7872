Starting with M12, it's possible to annotate the setters of delegated properties. That's very useful for Dagger 2. Example:

```
var handler: Handler by Delegates.notNull()
    @Inject set
```

However, sometimes the parameter of the setter needs to be annotated, too. Unfortunately the compiled doesn't allow the following syntax:

```
var handler: Handler by Delegates.notNull()
    @Inject set(@MainThread value)
```

Could you please consider adding the possibility?
