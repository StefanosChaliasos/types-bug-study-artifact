There shouldn't be error when one function is local (in function, class or current package) and if one function is imported by fully qualified name.

```kotlin
public fun String.replaceAll(regex: String, replacement: String): String = (this as java.lang.String).replaceAll(regex, replacement)

fun main(args: Array<String>)
{
	"".replaceAll("", "") // Overload resolution ambiguity with deprecated in kotlin stdlib
}
```

Seems related to KT-3697: Prefer more local function
