Take this code:
{code}
val x: Int? = null

fun foo() {
    x?.let {
        smth()
    }?: orElse()
}

fun smth() {}
fun orElse() {}
{code}

Idea code analysis will state that right part of elvis operator is useless and can be removed which is not correct.
As a result code cleanup task will also remove all such places and will produce incorrect program logic.
