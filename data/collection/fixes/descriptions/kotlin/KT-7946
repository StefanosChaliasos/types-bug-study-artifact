I'm struggling to let this compile https://github.com/puniverse/quasar-gradle-template/blob/kotlin-sus-call/src/main/kotlin/QuasarIncreasingEchoApp.kt#L60 but it doesn't no matter what I try. The error is "Type mismatch. Required 'kotlin.Int?', found 'V!'".

Adding actual type parameters doesn't help, the only thing that does is an explicit "SuspendableCallable()" surrounding the function expression.

Am I missing something or does the type inferrer actually (currently) need that help? Can it be improved in the latter case?
