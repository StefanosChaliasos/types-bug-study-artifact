{code:title=A.java}
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;

class A {
    static RetentionPolicy retention = null;
}
{code}

{code:title=1.kt}
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy.*

fun foo() =
    when (A.retention) {
        SOURCE -> "source"
        CLASS -> "class"
        RUNTIME -> "runtime"
    }
{code}

Warning contains the string `''{0}''` instead of the actual argument. By the way, if an argument expression was meant to be there, it's probably not a good idea because it may span across several lines, which will corrupt the error message. So I propose to remove it.

{code}
1.kt:4:11: warning: enum argument ''{0}'' can be null in Java, but exhaustive when contains no null branch
    when (A.retention) {
          ^
