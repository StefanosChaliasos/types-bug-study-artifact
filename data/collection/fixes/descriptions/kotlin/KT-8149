This occurs when getter and/or setter are generic.

```
object PropertyObject {
    operator fun <T> getValue(thisRef: Any, propertyMetadata: KProperty<*>): T = throw UnsupportedOperationException()
}
val topLevelProperty: Int by PropertyObject
```

Expected an error on '`by PropertyObject`' stating that none of the get functions is suitable.
