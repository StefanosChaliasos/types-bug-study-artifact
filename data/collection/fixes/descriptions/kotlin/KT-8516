This makes IDEA & the Kotlin compiler throw errors:

{code}
public class Test<T:Test<T>> {}
public class IntTest:Test<IntTest>() {}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val myTest: Test<*> = IntTest();
    println(myTest is IntTest)
}
{code}

Even if you remove the `IntTest` declaration (but leave the `main` code) IDEA will go crazy on the `myTest is IntTest` (it will stop doing syntax highlighting, for example). This might be similar to KT-4623 but it doesn't seem to be the same.
