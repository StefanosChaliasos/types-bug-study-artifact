So I declare state as a GraphicsState (an interface) as a property of the class like so:
{code:lang=kotlin|title=State Declaration}public override var state: GraphicsState = EmptyGraphicsState(this){code}

When I include the following line in the function though, it tries to cast state to a RomListingState in the loop (even though eventually it won't be):
{code:lang=kotlin|title=Bad Line}this.state = RomListingsState(this){code}

I included some screenshots showing the bytecode generated.

Without the bad line (bytecode for line *144*):
!without-bad-line.png!

With the bad line (bad line at *141* and bytecode at *146*):
!with-bad-line.png!

Putting the bad line in a function (bytecode at *146*):
!with-bad-line-function.png!

I was using this same code in a previous version of Kotlin (before M12) and it was working just fine.
