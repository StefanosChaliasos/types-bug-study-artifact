I have a very simple project (please, see attachment) with 2 Kolin classes and Java tests for them.

One of my classes is a wrapper (or container) for Double class:
{code}
package nuestracalculadora

public open class Numero(d : Double) {
    {
        this.valor = d
    }
//    private var valor : Double = 0.0 // OK
//    private var valor : Double       // OK
    private var valor : Double = 0.dbl // failed
    open public fun getValor() : Double {
        return valor
    }
}
{code}

If I write {{0.dbl}} in private field initializer then two tests failed.
{{0.0}} or empty initializer work as expected.

For me–± this behavior is weird.
