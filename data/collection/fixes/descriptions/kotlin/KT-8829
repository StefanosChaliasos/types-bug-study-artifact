When I enter following code into the editor, I get an accidental override issue from the IDE (see screenshot). However, this code should be valid and I can compile and run it just ok.
When I get rid off the generic type (replacing List with, say Int), everything is ok. 

Code:
{code}
public class ClassA<N> (
        val messenger: ClassB<N> = object : ClassB<N> {
            override public fun methodOne(param: List<N>) {
                println("List")
            }
        }
)

public interface ClassB<N> {
    public fun methodOne(param: List<N>)
}
{code}
