``` kotlin
open class A {
    private fun foo() { }
    inner class B : A() {
        init {
            this.foo() // Error: Cannot access 'foo': it is 'invisible_fake' in 'B'
        }
    }
}
```

It's unclear what is 'invisible_fake'. Method 'foo' cannot be invoked, because there is no method with this name in the class B -- private methods are not inherited.
