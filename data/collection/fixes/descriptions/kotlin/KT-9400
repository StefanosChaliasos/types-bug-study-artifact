Provide an annotation in Java source:
{code:lang=java}
public @interface ValuesJava {
    int intValue();
} {code}
Provide a Kotlin code using annotation as a value type
(like suggested here: http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/annotations.html#java-annotations):
{code:lang=kotlin}
fun introspect(p: ValuesJava) {
    println(p.intValue)
} {code}
Try code completion inside `intValue` in Kotlin source: get two variants: `intValue` and `intValue()`. Both looks not deprecated.
Select `intValue()`: get warning: "Annotation methods are deprecated."
Probably method form should not be suggested by completion.

NB: no such problem when annotation is used as annotation - not as a type.
