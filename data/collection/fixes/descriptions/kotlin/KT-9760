The follow code produces a confusing deprecation message in `1.0.0-beta-1038`.

```
internal interface A
interface B<T>
interface C : B<A>
```

```
Warning:(85, 25) Kotlin: Deprecated: sub-interface effective visibility 'public' should be the same or less permissive than its super-interface effective visibility 'internal'
```

It would be more clear if the warning were to indicate that the visibility problem comes from the type parameter.

Possibly attach to KT-2877?
