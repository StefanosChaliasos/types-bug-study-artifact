In the examples like
{code lang=Kotlin}
if (x == null) println(x) // x is always null
// or
if (x != null) return
x?.doSomething()          // x is always null
x!!.doMore()              // x is always null
{code}

At this moment x is just smart casted to Nothing which can help but is not visible enough.
