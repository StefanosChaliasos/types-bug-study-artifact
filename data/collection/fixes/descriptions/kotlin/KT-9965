{code:lang=kotlin}
enum class Foo {
  FOO;

  companion object {
    fun valueOf(something: String) {}
    val values = null
  }
}
{code}

The companion object hides the `values` and `valueOf` for the enum, with no further way to access them. This is most noticeable when implementing something like a `Map` in the companion object, which has `values` property. At the least, a warning should be emitted.
