I don't think this is intentionally allowed, it only works when the def returns a singleton type:

```Scala
scala> def get: 1 = { println("hi"); 1 }
def get: 1

scala> import get._

scala> toLong
hi
val res0: Long = 1

scala> toLong
hi
val res1: Long = 1
```

(if one really wants to pretend a prefix is stable, there's an `@uncheckedStable` annotation, though it's implemented by Scala 2 but not Dotty)
