## Minimized code

```Scala
   trait Box[+T]
   case class Foo[+S](s: S) extends Box[S]

   def unwrap2[A](b: Box[A]): A =
     b match
     case _: Foo[Int] => 0 // compiles, not ok

```

## Output

Compiles with no warning, which is not OK.

## Expectation

At least a warning about a pattern that cannot be checked at runtime should be emitted. The code shouldn't typecheck as well, but that's a secondary problem.
