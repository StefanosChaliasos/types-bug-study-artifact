Ping @DarkDimius @odersky, I'm not sure how to proceed from here.

The first commit illustrates the issue:
> When running TreeTypeMap in a miniphase, the tree we're transforming has
already been transformed by all the miniphases in the same group, but
the symbols we're looking at might be older than the trees, this means
that we can miss transforming some symbols as illustrated in details by
the added testcase which currently fails.

The second commit contains a hack to show that my diagnostic of the issue above is correct, but I don't know how to fix this properly:
> With this commit, tests/pos/treetypemap-miniphase.scala now compiles,
but this is only a hack: there are other instances of TreeTypeMap in the
compiler and they would all need to be run with "atGroupEnd", this is
tricky since we are not always calling TreeTypeMap in a context where we
have access to the current TreeTransformer (for example when we create a
TreeTypeMap inside TypeMap to deal with annotations), ideas and
alternative fixes welcome.
