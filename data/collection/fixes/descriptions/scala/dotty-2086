```scala
object Test {
  type Bound[Left, Right] >: Left <: Right
  type Foo = Bound[Any, Nothing]

  val x: Foo = 1
  val y: String = x
}
```
This compiles with dotty but fails in scalac as expected with:
```scala
error: lower bound Left does not conform to upper bound Right
  type Bound[Left,Right] >: Left <: Right
       ^
```
