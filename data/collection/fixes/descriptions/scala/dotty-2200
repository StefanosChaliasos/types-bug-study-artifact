I found one example with type aliases and higher kinded types where scalac reports no type errors while dotc reports E006 Unbound Identifier Error https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/commit/cf26eeb502b958a4f7b45530acfe74235f0dba0d#commitcomment-21672034

I bumped into this error while trying to compile https://github.com/johnynek/paiges with Dotty. The commands I ran were
```
$ scalac -version
Scala compiler version 2.12.1 -- Copyright 2002-2016, LAMP/EPFL and Lightbend, Inc.
$ scalac tests/pos/packageobjecttypealias/*.scala
$ ./bin/dotc tests/pos/packageobjecttypealias/*.scala
