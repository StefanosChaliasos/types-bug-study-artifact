The following code emits an error in dotty but not scalac:
```scala
object A {
  def foo: Int = 1
}
object B {
  def foo: Int = 2
}
object C {
  import A._
  import B._

  def foo: Int = 3

  println(foo)
}
```
```scala
13 |  println(foo)
   |          ^^^
   |          reference to `foo` is ambiguous
   |          it is both imported by import A._
   |          and imported subsequently by import B._
```

This is of course incorrect, the reference is not ambiguous, it must be `C.foo`.
