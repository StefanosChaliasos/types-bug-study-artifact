While upgrading the community build dotty-staging/scalatest fork to the latest dotty (0.1.1-bin-20170507-1014af3-NIGHTLY) and sbt-dotty 0.1.0-RC4 I hit an a MissingType error 
https://travis-ci.org/dotty-staging/scalatest/builds/229925482#L2104
during type erasure https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/blob/5093126421e333b2329399736e6d7ad327e3bdfa/compiler/src/dotty/tools/dotc/core/TypeErasure.scala#L496

I made some unsuccessful attempts to minimize the error, it seems to boil down to something like this

```scala
package foo
trait TestSuite {
  protected trait NoArgTest extends (() => Int)
}
trait CancelAfterFailure { self: TestSuite => }
```

To reproduce the error:

```
git clone https://github.com/dotty-staging/scalatest.git
cd scalatest
git checkout 1b2ea9013e4f71306f6dfc5f4e1ae0db85a46629
sbt scalatest/compile "last scalatest/compile:compileIncremental"
```
