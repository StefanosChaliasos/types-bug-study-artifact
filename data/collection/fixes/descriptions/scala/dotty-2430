The following subtyping test fails `Ycheck` after erasure:

```scala
class Test1(val x: Int) extends AnyVal
class Test2(val y: Test1) extends AnyVal
```

In tree checker:

```scala
tree.tpe <:< pt // tree.tpe = ErasedValueType(Test2, ErasedValueType(Test1, Int))($this)
                //       pt = Int
```

This is what causes erasure not to be `Ycheck`able. The next phase, `ElimErasedValueType`, removes the `ErasedValueType`s and casts so that it is again, `Ycheck`able.
