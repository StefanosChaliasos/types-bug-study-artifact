Consider:
```scala
> trait A { def x = "foo" }
> trait B { def x = 42 }
> val AB = new A with B { override def x = super.x }
> AB.x
java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.String cannot be cast to java.lang.Integer
```

I would expect the overriding method to be rejected, since it has type `String` and it is expected to be `Int & String`.
