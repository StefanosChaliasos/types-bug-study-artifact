```scala
trait A { type L }
trait B extends A { type L[X] }
```
In scalac this fails with:
```scala
 error: The kind of type L does not conform to the expected kind of type L in trait A.
B.this.L's type parameters do not match type L's expected parameters:
type L (in trait B) has one type parameter, but type L (in trait A) has none
trait B extends A { type L[X] }
                         ^
```
but it succeeds in dotty, which probably leads to interesting issues.
