In scala/collection-strawman, [this line](https://github.com/scala/collection-strawman/blob/map-ops/src/main/scala/strawman/collection/immutable/Map.scala#L37) gives the following compilation error:

~~~
def removeAll(keys: IterableOnce[K]): C = fromSpecificIterable(keys.iterator().foldLeft[CC[K, V]](coll)(_ - _))
                                                                                                        ^^^
                                 value `-` is not a member of CC[K, V]
~~~

Though `CC` is upper bounded by `MapOps` (see [here](https://github.com/scala/collection-strawman/blob/map-ops/src/main/scala/strawman/collection/immutable/Map.scala#L14)), which provides the `-` operation. Note that the `CC` upper bound is recursive.

This code compiles fine with Scala 2.12 and 2.13.
