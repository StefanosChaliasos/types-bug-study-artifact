```scala
class Foo {
  def foo[A](lss: List[List[A]]): Unit = {
    lss match {
      case xss: List[List[A]] =>
    }
  }
}
```
produces the following waring
```scala
-- [E091] Pattern Match Exhaustivity Warning: Foo.scala:5:16 -------------------
5 |      case xss: List[List[A]] =>
  |                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |       type arguments are not checked since they are eliminated by erasure
```

even if we know statically that the type will match.
