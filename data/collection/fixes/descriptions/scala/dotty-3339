This code shouldn't compile:
```scala
package outer {
  private class A

  package inner {
    object Test {
      def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
        println(new A)
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Because if you try to run it you get:
```scala
% dotr outer.inner.Test
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access class outer.A from class outer.inner.Test$
        at outer.inner.Test$.main(i3302.scala:7)
        at outer.inner.Test.main(i3302.scala
```

This code compiles and run with scalac because the class `A` is emitted as `public` whereas dotty emits it as `private`.
