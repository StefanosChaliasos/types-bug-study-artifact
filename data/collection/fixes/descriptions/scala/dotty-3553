```scala
class Test {
  def foo: List[1] = List(1)
}
```
When compiling with `-Xverify-signatures`:
```scala
2 |  def foo: List[1] = List(1)
  |      ^
  |compiler bug: created invalid generic signature for method foo in Test
  |signature: ()Lscala/collection/immutable/List<I>;
  |if this is reproducible, please report bug at https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues
```

`List<I>` is incorrect since Java generics can only range over reference types, it should be `List<Object>`, just like if the signature of `foo` was `List[Int]`.
