See [the scastie](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/yFo6yCv9TkiTmoCBhOuuLg).
The code is reproduced below:

```scala
class Base {
  class A
  class B extends A
  type of[+A0 <: A,T] = A0
}
object Base extends Base
import Base._
object Main {
  def foo = new B
  def foo2: B of Any = foo
  
  def main(args: Array[String]) = ()
}
```

Fails with:

```scala
-- [E056] Type Mismatch Error: /tmp/scastie722928142903515025/src/main/scala/main.scala:10:12 
10 |  def foo2: B of Any = foo
   |            ^
   |       Type argument Base.B does not conform to upper bound Base.this.A 
```

It works in Scalac, and it works in Dotty if the definitions are moved to the object!

PS: note that it has nothing to do with object `Base` having the same name as class `Base`.
