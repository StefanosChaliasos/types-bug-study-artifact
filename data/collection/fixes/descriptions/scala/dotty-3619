With SAMs in 2.12 the following works, but it fails in Dotty. I think this is Dotty's fault, correct me if I'm wrong.

```scala
  def addIfMissing(from: AbsolutePath, computeBuild: AbsolutePath => Build): Unit =
    cache.computeIfAbsent(from, path => computeBuild(path))
```
  
Error:
```
[error] -- [E007] Type Mismatch Error: /data/rw/code/scala/loop/rewo
rk/src/main/scala/bloop/State.scala:29:58
[error] 29 |    cache.computeIfAbsent(from, path => computeBuild(pat
h))[error]    |
  ^[error]    |found:    bloop.io.AbsolutePath => bloop.Build
[error]    |required: java.util.function.Function[_ >: bloop.io.Abso
lutePath, _ <: bloop.Build]
[error]    |
```
  
If you replace `path => computeBuild(path)` for the shorter `computeBuild` or even `computeBuild(_)` it also fails. I guess this is because Dotty does not have support for SAM types?
  
Scala 2 mode is enabled, didn't try without it.
