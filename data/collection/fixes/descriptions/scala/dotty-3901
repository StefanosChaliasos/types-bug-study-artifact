The following code produces an error complaining about `cond.type` not being stable. In the subsequent function application we nonetheless try to compute the intersection of non-value type `=> Boolean` and `Singleton`, which is caught by an assertion in `AndType`.

```scala
object Crash {
  def f(cond: => Boolean): cond.type = ???
  f(true)
}
```
