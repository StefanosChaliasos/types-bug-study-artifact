Replacing `erased` by `implicit` works, so this is specific to erased function types.
```scala
scala> def foo: (erased (x: Int) => Int) = erased x => 1 
1 |def foo: (erased (x: Int) => Int) = erased x => 1
  |                                                 ^
  |                         found:    erased Int => Int
  |                         required: (erased Int => Int){apply(x: Int): Int}
  |                         
```
