This is a very weird combination that I haven't been able to reduce further:
```scala
object Test {
  inline def foo(first: Int*)(second: String = "") = {}

  def test = {
    foo(1)()
  }
}
```

The body of test after typer is:
```scala
        {
          val first$1: Int* = [1 : Int]: Int*
          Test.foo(first$1)(Test.foo$default$2(first$1))
        }
```
Notice that `foo` hasn't been inlined away.
