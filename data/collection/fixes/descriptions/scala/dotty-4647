I am trying to get ScalaPB to compile with Dotty. It looks like `SeqLike` has been changed such that the original code doesn't compile with Dotty. I then found a signature that works with Dotty only, but not with ScalaPB. And finally one that works on both:

```scala
import scala.collection._
import scala.language.higherKinds

class F[A]

// Compiles with Scala 2, but not with dotty.
object Scala2Only {
  def func[A, C[A] <: SeqLike[A, C[A]]](x: F[C[A]]) = {}

  func(new F[Seq[Int]])
}

// Compiles with Dotty, but not with Scala 2
object DottyOnly {
  def func[A, CA <: SeqLike[A, CA]](x: F[CA]) = {}

  func(new F[Seq[Int]])
}

// Compiles on both
object Both {
  def func[A, C[_] <: SeqLike[_, C[_]]](a: F[C[A]]) = {}

  func(new F[Seq[Int]])
}
```

I am not sure if these incompatibilities is a bug or a known breaking change.
