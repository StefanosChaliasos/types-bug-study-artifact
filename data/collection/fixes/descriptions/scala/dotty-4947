In the snippet below, setting breakpoints in `isSubType` is hard if it's compiled by Dotty, because all of isSubType appears written on line 100.

```scala
transparent def track(f: => T): T = { ... f ... }

def isSubType(...) = track { // line 100
  body
]
```

Probably should be addressed before bootstrap, hence tentatively targeting milestone 0.10.
