```scala
package foo {
  object A {
    val x = 5
  }
}

package foo.bar {
  object A {
    val x = "foo"
  }
}

package foo {
  import foo.bar._

  object B {
    val y: Int = A.x // should resolve to `foo.A.x` or `foo.bar.A.x`?
  }
}
```
In the above example, in object `foo.B`, `A.x` resolves to `foo.A.x`. But if put in different files, it resolves to `foo.bar.A.x`.

My expectation is that the behaviour should be consistent whether or not the source is split into multiple files.
