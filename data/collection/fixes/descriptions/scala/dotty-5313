With Dotty:
```scala
scala> System.getClass                                                                                                                                                                                          
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: java/lang/System$
	at rs$line$1$.<init>(rs$line$1:1)
	...
```

with Scala 2:
```scala
scala> System.getClass
<console>:12: error: value getClass is not a member of object System
Note that System extends Any, not AnyRef.
Such types can participate in value classes, but instances
cannot appear in singleton types or in reference comparisons.
       System.getClass
```
