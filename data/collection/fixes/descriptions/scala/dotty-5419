In an attempt to define and use a *low-down-dirty lazyness implementation* I encountered an issue with modeling *thunks* using *implicit functions* using one file, while, when using many files, everything is fine.  

[https://github.com/PDBP/lazyness](https://github.com/PDBP/lazyness) is a GitHub project that as a README.md that explains the issue.
