The following code should not compile, as it allows unsound constructs:
```Scala
object Test {

  trait A { def polymorphic[x]: Int }
  val a = new A { val polymorphic = Unit }

}
```
(compiles in both `0.10.0-RC1` and `0.11.0-bin-20181113-bf5ba46-NIGHTLY`.)

The code fails as expected when `trait` is replaced with `abstract class`.
