The following code compiles fine in Scalac, but reports an error in Dotty:

```Scala
public class HasFieldAndMethod {
  public int cow = 2;
  public int cow() { return 1; } // Should access this one, prefer the method to the field
}
```

Error message:

```Scala
-- [E119] Duplicate Symbol Error: examples/HasFieldAndMethod.java:20:13 --------
20 |  public int cow() { return 1; } // Should access this one, prefer the method to the field
   |             ^
   |method cow in class HasFieldAndMethod is already defined as var cow: Int at line 19.
