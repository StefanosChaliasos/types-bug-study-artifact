The following code example leads to an "unspecified error":

```scala
trait A
  
def foo[E](f: (a: A) => (a.type, E)): E = {
  val a = new A {}
  f(a)._2
}

foo { a => (a, ()) }
```
It does type check when annotating the call to `foo`:
```scala
foo[Unit] { a => (a, ()) }
```

Also, removing the dependent function type from `foo` does typecheck:

```scala
def foo[E](f: (a: A) => (A, E)): E 
```

This might be related to #4130, but extracted to a separate issue since it might be fixable, independently.
