That message doesn't seem to be correct:
```scala
scala> def f(x: Int | Null): Int = x match { case i: Int => i; case _ => 0 }                                                                                                                                                                 
conversion from Int | Null to Int will always fail at runtime.
def f(x: Int | Null): Int
```
