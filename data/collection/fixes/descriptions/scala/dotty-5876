When trying to define `HasThisType` trait in following form
```Scala
    // this is compile-able code in both Scala and Dotty compilers
    type HasThisTypeLoverBounded[PThis] = HasThisType { type This <: PThis }
    trait HasThisType {
      type This >: this.type <: HasThisTypeLoverBounded[This]
    }
```

Dotty compiler crashes when that snippet is grown to several bigger snippets.

**(1)** While attempting to verify that "that.This#This <: that.This" like
([complete snippet](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/ibaklan/sPG8lZFjT66YuePrPeESxQ), [same snippet with commented problematic lines](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/ibaklan/hW50JG7BTq2MNXFc1GwbFw))
```Scala
      val that: HasThisType = ???
      // this line works in both Dotty and Scala
      val that1: that.This = that

      // this like fails in both Dotty and Scala but in Dotty it also makes compiler runtime crash
      val that2: that1.This = that1
```

**(2)** While trying to define abstract subclass with qualities similar to original `HasThisType`:
([complete snippet](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/ibaklan/yjC09ktyTk6eV4m3zMJ8Xw))
```Scala
    // this code is compile-able in Scala while in Dotty it makes compiler runtime crash
    type FooLikeTypeLoverBounded[PThis] = FooLike { type This <: PThis }
    class FooLike extends HasThisType {
      type This >: this.type <: FooLikeTypeLoverBounded[This]
    }
```
However simple instantiation/subclassing of such `HasThisType` is still possible in Dotty:
([complete snippet](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/ibaklan/0HUnMUh1QkuBZRmkFHTWyA))
```Scala
    // this code is compile-able in both Scala and Dotty compiler
    class Foo extends HasThisType {
      type This = Foo
    }
```

FYI: positive case (snippet which compiles and works as expected with Scala compiler)
