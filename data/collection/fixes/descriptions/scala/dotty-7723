In the code bellow, a default argument causes automatic generation of a companion object. This object seems to inherit the `@alpha` annotation from the class. Then, the annotations on the class and the object clash.

## minimized code

```Scala
@scala.annotation.alpha("A") class B(i: Int = 1)
```

## output
```
1 |@scala.annotation.alpha("A") class B(i: Int = 1)
  |^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |@alpha annotation "A" clashes with other definition is same scope
```

## expectation

The companion object should be generated in such a way, that its definition does not clash with the class.
