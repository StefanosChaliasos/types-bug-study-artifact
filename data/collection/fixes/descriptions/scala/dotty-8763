## Minimized code

```Scala
import cats.syntax.all._

trait AAA[T]

object Test {
  implicit def aaaShow[T](implicit showT: cats.Show[T]): cats.Show[AAA[T]] = ???
  
  ("Enforcing union type": Int | Unit) //This will give a Type Mismatch Error
}
```
My build.sbt:
```
libraryDependencies += ("org.typelevel" %% "cats-core" % "2.2.0-M1").withDottyCompat(scalaVersion.value)
scalaVersion := "0.23.0-RC1"
```

## Output
Expect the `Type Mismatch Error` almost immediately.

## Expectation
The compilation should not take more than a few seconds!

If we replace the `implicit def` (that is a valid scala2 code) with:
```
given aaaShow[T](using cats.Show[T]) as cats.Show[AAA[T]] = ???
```
The compilation takes around 45 seconds (also very slow)

Also, there is not any to stop compilation
After a `SIGINT` the sbt prints: `[warn] Canceling execution...` but it never ends.
I don't know where to report this. I have to send a `SIGKILL` to sbt and to bloop/metals
