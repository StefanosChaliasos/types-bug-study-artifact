Was told to create an issue for this:
https://gitter.im/lampepfl/dotty?at=5ebb35eb8c044c191498af5c

## Minimized code

```Scala
trait Cons[X, Y]

def solve[X, Y](using Cons[X, Y] =:= Cons[1, Cons[2, Y]]) = ()

@main def main = solve
```

## Expectation
My first expectation for the above code was that it wouldn't compile at all. Not sure if that's the correct answer though. I'd also expect that if it did compile, I could supply the types printed by `-Xprint:typer`, and it would continue to compile. 

The code does not compile with Scala 2.
