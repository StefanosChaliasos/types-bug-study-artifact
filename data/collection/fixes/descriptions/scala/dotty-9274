## Minimized code

This could probably be minimized further.

```Scala
import cats.Order
import cats.implicits._

def test[F[_], B](lhs: F[B], tolerance: B)(implicit ord: Order[F[B]]): Boolean =
  (lhs: F[B]) <= (tolerance: B)
```

Cats 2.1.1 compiled for Scala 2.13.

## Output

Compiles and results in a `ClassCastException`.

## Expectation

Shouldn't compile. The ascriptions aren't necessary to trigger the bug, I just included them for clarity.

This may be specific to the Scala 2 unpickler. I wasn't able to reproduce it with this pure-Dotty minimization:

```scala
object Foo {

  implicit def toSyntax[A](a: A): Syntax[A] =
    new Syntax[A](a)

  class Syntax[A](self: A) {
    def <=(other: A)(implicit A: Order[A]): Boolean = true
  }

  def test[F[_], B](lhs: F[B], tolerance: B)(implicit ord: Order[F[B]]): Boolean =
    (lhs: F[B]) <= (tolerance: B)
}
```

The above fails to compile, as I would expect.
