## Minimized code

```Scala
package bugs.shadowing

object x {
  def f421() = 1
}

object y {
  def f421() = true
}

import x.f421
import y.f421

object test {
  println(f421())
}
```

## Output

```scala
[error] 15 |  println(f421())
[error]    |          ^^^^
[error]    |       Reference to f421 is ambiguous,
[error]    |       it is both imported by name by import dotty.DottyPredef.{...}
[error]    |       and imported by name subsequently by import bugs.shadowing.y.f421
[error] one error found
```

## Expectation
```scala
[error] 15 |  println(f421())
[error]    |          ^^^^
[error]    |       Reference to f421 is ambiguous,
[error]    |       it is both imported by name by import import bugs.shadowing.x.f421
[error]    |       and imported by name subsequently by import bugs.shadowing.y.f421
[error] one error found
```
