Hi everyone,

A bug in the compilation of Scala projects with Scala 2.12 has been reported here: https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3314 and here: https://github.com/lagom/lagom/pull/887#issuecomment-315833219

It could be reproduced thanks to the Lagom PR (https://github.com/lagom/lagom/pull/887) where I try to update the version of Scala used in Lagom.

Do you need more informations ?
