scalac allows one to rename wildcard to an arbitrary identifier:

```scala
scala> object Foo { class A }
defined object Foo

scala> import Foo.{_ => Bla}
import Foo._

// A is available because the import is a wildcard one despite the rename!
scala> new A
res1: Foo.A = Foo$A@687a0e40

// Bla is not available
scala> new Bla
<console>:16: error: not found: type Bla
       new Bla
```

This should be ruled out by the parser. dottyc does rule it out at the parsing time.
