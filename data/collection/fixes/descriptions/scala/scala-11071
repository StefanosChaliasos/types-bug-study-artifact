Welcome to Scala 2.13.0-M4 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_181).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala> case class X[A](a: A) { def y: a.type = a }
defined class X

scala> X(42).y
scala.reflect.internal.Types$TypeError: type mismatch;
 found   : Int
 required: ?#a.type

That entry seems to have slain the compiler.  Shall I replay
your session? I can re-run each line except the last one.
[y/n]
