Example:

```scala
implicit class RichLiteral[L <: Singleton](lit: L) {
  def apply[T]: (L, Option[T]) = (lit, None)
}

'symbol.apply[Int] // compiles
'symbol[Int] // does not compile, results in [error] ';' expected but '[' found.
```

What I expected is for `'symbol[Int]` to compile successfully.

Scala's [grammar](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.13/13-syntax-summary.html) would suggest that this should be possible. This does not work for all literals (for `String` it is understandable as it already has an `apply` defined).

I'm working with scalac 2.13.0-M4.
