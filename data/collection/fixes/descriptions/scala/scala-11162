I receive this error message in multiple places in my code.  I've included a snip here, compiled against 2.12.6.  Also tried 2.12.4 and saw the same problem.  

For full effect clone and build https://github.com/gzoller/ScalaJack on branch feature/v7_staging

```
      json match {
        case JsonArray(x) =>
          builder.append('[')
          ops.foreachArrayElement(x.asInstanceOf[ops.ArrayElements], { (index, element) =>
            if (index > 0) {
              builder.append(",")
            }
            helper(element)
          })
          builder.append(']')
