[scalajs-react](https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react) doesn't compile with 2.12.7. (Nor do any downstream projects).

Here is Travis compiling with both 2.12.6 and 2.12.7:
https://travis-ci.org/japgolly/scalajs-react/builds/434352061

The error seems to be that this implicit conversion [here](https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/japgolly/scalajs/react/component/Generic.scala#L11-L12) is no longer being considered.
