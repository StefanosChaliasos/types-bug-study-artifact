The checks implied by the last case in an exhaustive match are useless, and could be elided.

Consider the simple example from https://gist.github.com/szegedi/477b8030d1bfab33cc6d44a78d9396f4, but it applies generally:

```
b match {
  case true  => 10
  case false => 11
}
```

is compiled to

```
if (b) 10
else if (!b) 11
else throw new MatchError(b)
```

We do a lot better on the equivalent:
```
b match {
  case true  => 10
  case _ => 11
}
```

exhaustiveness should be enough to conclude that `case false` (or any last case in an exhaustive match) could be replace by `case _`
