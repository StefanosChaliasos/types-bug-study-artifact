The following combination causes a compiler crash in typer with Scala 2.12.1:

```scala
trait Foo[T]
object Foo {
  val foo: Foo[Any] { type Bar = Any } = new Foo { def baz(): Any = () }
}
```

I think the correct behavior should be to just output the error regarding the missing parameters on `new Foo`, and give up. Full output is here: [error.txt](https://github.com/scala/scala-dev/files/873808/error.txt).

The crash also appears with 2.12.0, but not 2.11.8.
