@milessabin @mpilquist has kindly provided this minimized example:

```scala
scala> object Foo {
     |   def apply[A]: Int = 0
     |   def apply[F[_]](implicit x: Int): Boolean = true
     | }
defined object Foo

scala> Foo[Int]
           ^
       error: Int takes no type parameters, expected: one
```
The whole discussion is here :point_up: [April 15, 2019 12:17 PM](https://gitter.im/mpilquist/simulacrum?at=5cb4686125686a7dc3347600). 

Confirmed on both 2.13-M5 and RC1.

This doesn't occur if the methods have a different number of type parameters.
