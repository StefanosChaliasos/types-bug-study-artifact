This works:
```scala
scala> import java.util.stream.Stream
import java.util.stream.Stream

scala> Stream.of(1,2,3).map(_ + 1)
res20: java.util.stream.Stream[?0] = java.util.stream.ReferencePipeline$3@27014faf
```

But then, you'd think that this should work:

```scala
scala> Stream.of(1,2,3).map(_.toString)
                              ^
       error: type mismatch;
        found   : Int => String
        required: java.util.function.Function[_ >: Int, _]

```

It can be made to work only by including the map type param:
```scala
scala> Stream.of(1,2,3).map[String](_.toString)
res22: java.util.stream.Stream[String] = java.util.stream.ReferencePipeline$3@7e7daeac
```

This would hopefully work because it does actually work in java:

```java
Stream.of(1,2,3).map(i -> i.toString());
```
