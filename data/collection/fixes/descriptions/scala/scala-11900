Hello! Scala compiler allows trailing comma in the lambda body, function body and constructors. Is it bug or correct behavior? Looks a little weird.

In a [SIP-27](https://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/trailing-commas.html) I've read:

> Following Dr. Martin Oderskyâ€™s suggestion, the proposal is that trailing commas are only supported in comma-separated elements that are enclosed by parentheses, square brackets or curly braces (), ], and }, respectively).

Is function bodies comma-separated elements?

## reproduction steps

```scala
List(1, 2, 3).map {
  a => a + 1,
}

class A() {
  println("a"),
}

def b() = {
  println("b"),
}

new A()
b()
```

## problem

Code compiles

## expectation

Code doesn't compile
