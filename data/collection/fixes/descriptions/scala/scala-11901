## reproduction steps

```scala
@SerialVersionUID(1L)
trait T
```

## problem

This compiles, but the annotation doesn't actually do anything (and it can't do anything since we can't add a static field to an interface)

## expectation

This should emit an error, like https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/8429
