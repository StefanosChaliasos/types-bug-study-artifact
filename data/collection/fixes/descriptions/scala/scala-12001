## reproduction steps

using Scala 2.13.1 or 2.13.2,

```scala
class Event[+T](weight: Int, data: T) extends Ordered[Event[_ <: T]] {
  def compare(that: Event[_ <: T]): Int = weight - that.weight
}
```

## problem
Compiler should print an error message, it should not be crashed.
If I replace ```weight - that.weight``` with ```???```, I receive an expected error.
