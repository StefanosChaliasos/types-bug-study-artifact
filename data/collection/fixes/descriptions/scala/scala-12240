## reproduction steps

using Scala 2.13.4

```scala
scala> Vector(1) match {
  case Vector(_ @ _*) => ???
}
```

## problem

> match may not be exhaustive.
> It would fail on the following input: `Vector1()`

The match is totally exhaustive. Unfortunately, scalac doesn't know. `Vector.unapplySeq` seems to be using name-based pattern matching to return a `SeqFactory.UnapplySeqWrapper`. But name-based pattern matching can't AFAIK provide irrefutable patterns, so the pattern ends up refutable, and the warning (with the somewhat odd counterexample) is emitted.
