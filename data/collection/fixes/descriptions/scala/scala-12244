## reproduction steps

using Scala 2.13.4

```scala
  object Kind extends Enumeration {
    val Tiny, Small, Large = Value
  }

  def maxLo(kind: Kind.Value): Int =
    kind match {
      case Kind.Tiny  => 1
      case Kind.Small => 2
      case Kind.Large => 6
    }
```

## problem

```
ProgFoor.scala:9: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following input: (x: bugs.ProgFoor.package.Kind.Value forSome x not in (Large, Small, Tiny))
    kind match {
    ^
```
I expect no warning while exhaustivity is quite an evidence.
