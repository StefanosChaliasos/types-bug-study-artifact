## reproduction steps

using Scala 2.13.4

```scala
val List(x, y) = List(1, 2)
```

## problem

Warning appears:
```
[error] It would fail on the following inputs: List(_), Nil
[error]       val List(x, y) = List(1, 2)
```

There wasn't a warning until 2.13.4.

Should the new patmat strictness (which is awesome btw) apply to destructures like this? It would be valuable in this case:

```scala
val a = List(1, 2)
val List(x, y) = a
```

but when the right-hand side is a single known and specific pattern (in our case `_ :: _ :: Nil`), the warning is spurious.
