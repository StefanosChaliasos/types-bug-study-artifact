## reproduction steps

using Scala 2.13.4,

```scala
trait SomeImplicit
trait Foo {
  final def == [R](right : R)(implicit imp : SomeImplicit) : Boolean = true
}
case class Bar(foo : Foo) //error: could not find implicit for parameter imp
```

## problem

It seems #10536 wasn't completely resolved. The above example doesn't compile.
