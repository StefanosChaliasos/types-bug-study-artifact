## reproduction steps

Using Scala 2.12.11, the following snippet produces a compiler warning.

```scala
  sealed trait A
  object BObject extends A
  val B = BObject: A

  BObject match {
    case B  => println("all good")
  }
```
```
match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following input: BObject
  BObject match {
```

## problem
The compiler warning is erroneous.
