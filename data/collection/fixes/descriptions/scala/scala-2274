This used to work in previous versions, but has broken in the current nightly build:

scala> future(1+2)
<console>:6: error: could not find implicit value for parameter runner:scala.concurrent.TaskRunner[Unit].
       future(1+2)

scala> spawn(())
<console>:7: error: could not find implicit value for parameter runner:scala.concurrent.TaskRunner[Unit].
       spawn(())



Implicit params seem to have been breaking a lot of different things recently (I've been having problems with collections too). Is library use of implicits getting too complex?
