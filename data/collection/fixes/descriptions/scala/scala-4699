1) implicit search and implicit conversion search treat undetermined type parameters differently
2) constraints are carried over in an ad-hoc way (by tracking undetermined type parameters in the context)
 --> this works for influencing the inference of type parameters by "later aspects" of the expression, but not for inferring implicit values, since these cannot be left undetermined while type checking an expression (see [#SI-4653])

the idea of generalising tracking of undetermined implicit types (type parameters)/implicit values and their constraints could drive the solution for [SI-3340], [SI-3346], [SI-2781] and [SI-3270]
