I am getting a compiler error.

I am trying to create my own extensions to scala collections. It's complicated, so I started taking List and making a copy and renaming List to IList everywhere, and similarly copied ListBuffer -> IListBuffer, Nil->INil, etc. This "should" create my own variation on the theme. 

So far so good, but I get a compiler error that refers to the equals method of IListBuffer, on the line that calls super.equals(that).

I have done very little to this code. It should still be pretty much the same as the collections library (and that certainly compiles).

Error in Scala compiler: Unexpected tree in genLoad: IListBuffer.super/class scala.reflect.generic.Trees$Super at: source-C:\svn\sb\Scala1\src\java\com\mjb\rleList\IListBuffer.scala,line-237,offset=6823	Scala1		Unknown	Scala Problem

If I rewrite the equals method to not use super, then I can get everything to compile. E.g., changing super.equals(that) to this.asInstanceOf[Buffer[A]].equals(that) compiles fine.
