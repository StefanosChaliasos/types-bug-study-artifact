i was experimenting with implicits trying to figure out exactly which implicit is picked when, and there was a problem which i cannot explain other than "it's not a feature, it's a bug!"

Correct1:
i import 2 conversions which are ambigous, compiler complains, everything ok.

Bug1: 
Same situation, both conversions are imported - but the compiler doesn't complain.
