While working on a project I started seeing the compiler crash even with 2048M of heap available.  I was able to track it down to a pattern match and I've posted a project that shows the behavior to github: https://github.com/davewhittaker/pattern_match_bug.  If you clone it and run "sbt compile" you'll see the issue.  A jstack of the process during the compile shows that it gets hung up in scala.tools.nsc.matching.MatrixAdditions$MatrixExhaustiveness$ExhaustivenessChecker and I've posted a gist of that as well https://gist.github.com/1627701.
