As described in http://groups.google.com/group/scala-internals/browse_thread/thread/45185b341aeb6a30, ConstantTypes are susceptible to a hashing problem that prevent them from being transformed by erasure.

Currently there's an ugly hack in place: https://github.com/scalamacros/kepler/blob/a7867812ed7501b22c25ccc67a7e109652ab1486/src/reflect/scala/reflect/internal/Types.scala#L1902, which needs to be fixed.
