one.scala:
trait X { def f(p: scala.tools.selectivecps.CPSUtils) = null }

two.scala:
class Y extends X

mkdir bin
scalac -cp continuations.jar -d bin one.scala
scalac -cp bin -d bin two.scala

Second call to scalac causes the compiler crash included in the attachment.

Note that this has nothing to do continuations.jar; any JAR will do, provided it is omitted from the second compilation. Continuations.jar was chosen because it's part of the standard distribution and isn't on the default classpath.
