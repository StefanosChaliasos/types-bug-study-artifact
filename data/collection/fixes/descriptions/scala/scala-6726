I am having problems with 2.10-RC2 for this match

Code: https://gist.github.com/8995c2131c5d3e49c629

It compiles fine with 2.9.2.
On eclipse I get a StackOverflow error that suggests me to close the workbench.
On the command line output the compiler shows an error during phase patmat (scala.tools.nsc.typechecker.PatternMatching$Logic$And.equals)

Output: https://gist.github.com/ae82deae3b906a8e8b89

Paul Phillips figured out the problem: the 324 case was there twice. However the compiler should not crash because of this. But it should not compile (also a bug in 2.9.x I guess).
