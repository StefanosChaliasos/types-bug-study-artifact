The problem has been mentioned here:
https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-internals/b95Y-GbXVGA/discussion

The gist is that typer inlines compile time constants (e.g. references to static fields defined in Java) and forgets about the original tree that referred to a constant (e.g. to a field) which makes dependency analysis impossible.

According to Adriaan pattern matcher does not need constants to be inlined because it works with types. I couldn't readily find a reason why we need to inline those constants in typer so we probably should move this all the way to erasure.

I'm logging a ticket to not forget to investigate if we can do that for 2.10.2.
