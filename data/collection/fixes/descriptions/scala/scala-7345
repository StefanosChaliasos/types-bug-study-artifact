As noticed while fixing #7319:

     - encapsulate the error/warnings buffers in Contexts, and
       only expose the minimal representation necessary to propagate
       these between contexts, filter, and issue. This should fix
       a number of places where buffered warnings are not treated
       correctly (these were added recently, but places like `withSavedContext`
       were not updated.)
     - bring order to other menagerie of state within Context.
       It might be simpler and safer to carry it around in a nested
       case class, so we could use the 'copy' method to selectively
       modify one or two fields.
