I'm getting the following error:

[error] type mismatch;
[error]  found   : Double
[error]  required: AnyRef
[error] Note: an implicit exists from scala.Double => java.lang.Double, but
[error] methods inherited from Object are rendered ambiguous.  This is to avoid
[error] a blanket implicit which would convert any scala.Double to any AnyRef.
[error] You may wish to use a type ascription: `x: java.lang.Double`.

This error is likely correct (I have "Int with Foo" types floating around), however it has no location information (file name, line number), so it is very hard to identify the actual source of the problem (and therefore to reproduce it).
