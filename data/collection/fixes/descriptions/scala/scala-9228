The attached program causes a compiler error, resulting in the attached backtrace.

I haven't yet found a way round it (although I'm new to Scala) so I can't yet send you the most similar program that does work (and still does what I want); commenting out the line "propmap += newBinding" does get it to compile.

I've looked for an existing similar bug and couldn't find any.

The compilation is happening inside gradle, and I can't get it tell me the compiler version, so I've reported it against the library version it says it's building with.
