   When I compile the attached Scala program of 1232 lines of code,
   the compiler crashes with a java.lang.OutOfMemoryError (Java heap
   space) exception. The size of the file Data.scala is the
   culprit. If I shorten Data.scala substantially, e.g. to 500 LOCs,
   the problem disappears. A 16 GB machine should not run out of
   memory on such a small source program.

The error message can be found in the attached file error-report.txt.
The files causing the crash are Data.scala,  Event.scala and should
be compiled together.
